    <h1>Howdy!!!</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm <a href="https://silvershorthair.github.io/AboutMe">Silver</a>, and welcome to my website!!! I don't really know what the purpose of this is besides just making a fun thing. I might try and incorporate a blog, a portfolio, or maybe some other practical aspect. Who knows. Point is it exists, and you have me to thank. That's a lie.
        <h3>CREDITS:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My friend <a href="https://miastonished.github.io/">Mia</a>, who's helped me a lot with the HTML and CSS and Javascript and even the website existing. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have gone "Huh, this is a silly website, I should learn HTML and do something cool like this too!" You can find the link to her website by clicking on her name (and in a few other spots around the site)</li>
            <!--Hello Batashock. I know that you're searching though the website looking for the secret, so I'll make sure that you see this message. THANKS TO BATASHOCK FOR BEING ANOTHER INSPIRATION FOR CREATING THE WEBSITE THANKS BATASHOCK GO TO HIS SITE https://batashock.cf/coolsite/ THAT PAGE SPECIFICALLY GO TO THAT ONE-->
            <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>, which was an incredibly useful website for learning how to use HTML and CSS. I'm sure that the "largest web developer site on the internet" will greatly appreciate the thanks.</li>

                <details>
                    <summary>My friends, who've made a few things for the site. Here's the credits in order of where what they made is on the site.</summary>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CaptainQuerky, who made the "I AM NOT A FURRY" ad that goes above all of my social media links.</li>
                        <li>Batashock, Skysupercharged, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1iGr2fqltcxJgy29MHUvSg">Jir0we</a>, HiyaDerred, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClZOEokL1t7ZVVzeKUhQY8w">wolfdragon245</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC344lFkUfKtV-pbAdVocu0g">Autumn</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Hanzoooo">Hanzoooo</a>, Flippityjibbet, and Mia, who all made reviews for the site. Their links should be available at their reviews, and if not, I've linked them here.</li>
                        <li>Mia again but this time for giving me funny.tff</li>

        <h3>A few final notes:</h3>
        I hope you enjoy the site. At the start, I was trying to go for a bit of a retro web design aesthetic, which I have partially drifted away from by accident, but I'll try to make it somewhat resemble an old website, which reminds me, ads. There's a few fake advertisements on the site made by friends
        and I. They're apart of the experience, so if you don't see any ads, then your adblocker might've blocked them. Preferably, disable your adblocker for the site so that you don't miss any of the fun stuff made for it.

            Hello, my fellow Americans. The United States is a beautiful country. There's many sights to see, and similarly, there's many sites to see.<br>
            However, our lives, just like me, have a term limit, and there's no guarantee we'll get re-elected to live another day. We have to see the best of the US, sights and sites.<br>
            Which is why I'd like to endorse the most beautiful sight and the most beautiful site I've ever seen, and suggest to you, America, that you go and see them both right now.<br>
            For the sights, I suggest Yellowstone National Park, and for the sites, I suggest the official Silver Shorthair Website. Nothing I've ever seen, and nothing I ever will see<br>
            will ever top the Official Silver Shorthair Website. Go check it out right now.

            legend says that any man that does not visit Siler Shorterhir's website. will be hit. man. man hit. hitting man. man. man is hit. hit was the man
            obviously that is just a myth though<br /> because Silivrer Shoirtairhairorhair would never harm maim or dismember any living being in any way that would make it apparent that such a thing had occurred

            Greetings fellow cyber citizens! After a long day of surfing the web (The WORLD-WIDE WEB, that is!) you may find yourself weary from your travels. From cat videos to the rugged terrain<br />of MySpace, sometimes the internet can just be too much. Why not, instead relax on the Silver Shorthair website? Indeed, this is the perfect place for a good cyber citizen to take a nice rest.<br />Shoot the breeze, update your silvers, sell your soul to a paper cat, and overall just have a great time! Farewell, and surf on!
