<h4 id="C1">1) Silver Shorthair is your friend!!!</h4>
<p>Silver Shorthair would <em>NEVER</em> do something actively harmful to your health. This includes, but is not limited to the following: Taking your organs and selling them for profit to buy new graphics cards, turning you into a 3D model but neglecting to give you a mouth, feeding you to any breed of dog (excluding Alaskan Huskies, Beagles, Soft-Coated Wheaten Terriers, or Norwegian Elkhounds), preforming unwanted surgeries on you without a license, psychological torture, forcing you to watch Ratatoing 8 times and then forcing you to write a review nitpicking every detail about it, or murder in the first degree.
<br>
<h4 id="C2">2) Silver Shorthair is a trustworthy individual!!!</h4>
<pre>
      Do you really think that letting Silver Shorthair into your home
is a bad  idea?
					HA
T hat really is a fooish move.
To demon
strate
Please enjoy this comic, illustrated by anyone but Silver   Shorthair.

</pre>
<h4 id="C3">3) Silver Shorthair hasn't been over in forever!!!</h4>
<p>Hahaha, such fun you and Silver had the last time that you let them into your home!!! But geez, it has been quite the while, hasn't it? Silver's been everywhere, and based on our calculations, Silver hasn't been at the location of your home in at least:</p>
<p style="color:#ff6363;font-size:200%;"><b>40,000 YEARS</b></p>
<p>Well, it's been a bit, hasn't it? You and Silver really need to catch up sometime. And what's a better time than the present?</p>
<br>
<h4 id="C4">4) Silver Shorthair's home has experienced an unforseen disaster which leaves it in unlivable conditions!!!</h4>
<p>YIKES, looks like Silver shorthair's home has experienced an unforseen disaster, they can't stay there. If only Silver had a reliable friend who'd be willing to let them into your home. Oh wait, you there, reading this article!!! Yes, that's right, you, the reader, are the perfect reliable friend. If you have any of the following traits:<br>
1) A home<br>
2) A soul<br>
You may be eligible for the entrance of Silver Shorthair into your home. Think of all the things that could happen by letting Silver Shorthair into your home (for a list of things that COULD NOT happen by letting Silver Shorthair into your home, please refer to point 1.)<br>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
Thank you for reading this helpful list of reasons as to why you should let Silver Shorthair into your home. You will now let me into your home.

Hello, my fellow Americans. The United States is a beautiful country. There's many sights to see, and similarly, there's many sites to see. However, our lives, just like me, have a term limit, and there's no guarantee we'll get re-elected to live another day. We have to see the best of the US, sights and sites. Which is why I'd like to endorse the most beautiful sight and the most beautiful site I've ever seen, and suggest to you, America, that you go and see them both right now. For the sights, I suggest Yellowstone National Park, and for the sites, I suggest the official Silver Shorthair Website. Nothing I've ever seen, and nothing I ever will see will ever top the Official Silver Shorthair Website. Go check it out right now.
