        <p>
            The Silver Shorthair Website is critically acclaimed, with reviews from all across the globe, all saying that this is the go-to website for all of your internet needs,
            and you think your measly, pathetic little review will be of any value to her? We're glad to hear that, in order to make a review, please read the required information
            for your review, fill it out in the text box, and submit. Depending on the quality of your review, Silver may add it to the reviews section.
            </p>
        <h2>How do I write a review?</h2>
        <p>
        For your review, you'll need the following:
        <ul>
            <li>The review's content itself. Depending on your review, we may omit certain details such as vulgarity, personal information, or questioning of Silver's motives.</li>
            <li>A name. You can pick any variety of name, including remaining anonymous. You can also claim to be a government official or organization, such as a current or former President of the United States,
            the company McDonald's, etc. As we have no way to verify these claims, we will likely just assume they are true.</li>
            <li>The year the review was written. Similarly to claiming to be a government official, we have no way of verifying this claim, and likewise we will also likely assume it to be true.</li>
            <li>A link for your name to lead to. You can make this any link, such as a link to a personal social media, a link to an amusing video of a cat, etc.</li>
        </ul>
            And it's as simple as that. When you're done, your review should look something like this:<br /><br />
            <div class="Real">
                            <blockquote cite="Flippityjibbet">
                Greetings fellow cyber citizens! After a long day of surfing the web (The WORLD-WIDE WEB, that is!) you may find yourself weary from your travels. From cat videos to the rugged terrain<br />of MySpace, sometimes the internet can just be too much. Why not, instead relax on the Silver Shorthair website? Indeed, this is the perfect place for a good cyber citizen to take a nice rest.<br />Shoot the breeze, update your silvers, sell your soul to a paper cat, and overall just have a great time! Farewell, and surf on!
            </blockquote>

            Now of course, writing a review is quite the responsibility, and you may not get it right the first time. That may give you the desire to try again,
            but we are legally required to inform you that we do not endorse writing multiple reviews, as that may mislead the shareholders.
            On an unrelated note, however, here is an interesting fun fact: there is nothing technically stopping you from making multiple reviews,
            and neither we nor the shareholders have any way of knowing if you have. We hope you enjoyed this unrelated fun fact.
        <h2>When will my review arrive on the site?</h2>
            Unfortunately, there is no way for you to know exactly when your review has arrived. Typically, reviews are added when the site is updated.
            There is also the chance your review may never get added. You will know this if the site gets updated after your submission and your review is not included.
            There could be any variety of reasons your review was not included, and unfortunately we do not provide feedback at this time. Please do not spam reviews.
            <h2>So what are you waiting for? Submit your review now!</h2>
