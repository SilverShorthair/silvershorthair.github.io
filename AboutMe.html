            I'm Silver, a user of the World Wide Web! I'm an autistic trans girl (she/her) and I do stuff sometimes.
            Sometimes I do <a href="portfolio/index.html">Blender stuff</a>, sometimes I do <a href="edits.html">severely amateur image-editing</a>, sometimes I do
            HTML and CSS (and even JavaScript sometimes, but anyone who's ever used JavaScript knows that's not a fun one), sometimes I play games, and sometimes I
            even record a <a href="https://youtu.be/vktBudL9OZE" title="I'm sorry Sky and Jir0we">YouTube video</a>. I mentioned autism, and yeah, sometimes I autism
            too. Notable examples include Portal 2, which I was
            <a href="https://hiyaderred.github.io/">peer</a>-<a href="https://wolfdragon245.github.io/">pressured</a> into playing back in 2020/2021.
            It then proceeded to become one of my favorite games of all time, so thanks for that. You can read my
            <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198833308729/recommended/620/">Steam review</a>, which is something I wrote in 2021 that I still agree
            with today and don't think is relatively embarassing, which is a rare occurance these days.<br />In 2022, I got really into Lemon Demon, specifically the
            album <a href="https://lemondemon.bandcamp.com/album/spirit-phone">Spirit Phone</a>. Since then, I've listened to every other album, and I've been able to
            really appreciate most of them (Clown Circus and Candle Shop are pretty rough but they've still got some good ones). it's really hard to pick a favorite
            song, so
            <a href="https://youtu.be/hPMnIymc3Cs">just</a>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/849q2h1OkKs">have</a>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/yAoHoplsxFo">one</a>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/0ukn5UD8xm4">f</a><a href="https://youtu.be/ci9y6tJc9tY" title="Couldn't just pick one from this album">r</a><a href="https://youtu.be/wen1_32bCSo">o</a><a href="https://youtu.be/ZxgzCr6PGeo" title="This one actually means quite a bit to me">m</a>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/1UMxhZlDzOs">each</a>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/nPqIn-fJdPM">album</a>.
            <i><a href="https://youtu.be/cQP-hr195uw">cough</a></i>.
            And I guess there's also <a href="https://youtu.be/8ws-49HHK60">Nature Tapes</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/rbMY-NMT_vc">I Am Become Christmas</a>.<br />
            I'm not sure if I <a href="prediction.png">willed this one into existence,</a> but back in 2023 I bought Doom because of
            <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134292-myhousewad/">MyHouse.wad</a> (very smart decision considering MyHouse needs Doom II) and predicted
            that I'd hyperfixate on Doom. I then proceeded to hyperfixate on Doom. Regardless of if I accidentally wasted some sort of genie wish on that or not, Doom
            is up there in my list of favorite things, and I absolutely love the entire franchise
            (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098293/DOOM_Eternal_The_Ancient_Gods__Part_Two/" title="DO NOT PLAY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES">with some exceptions</a>).<br />
            The most recent thing to be added to the hyperfixation list is Inscryption. When I first started Inscryption back in
            July, I was extremely burnt-out and constantly stressed and exhausted, so I didn't get very far. It wasn't until November that I really started playing it,
            and holy shit it is a fantastic game. All I'll say is I wholeheartedly recommend it. Don't look up anything about it, don't watch anything about it
            (EVEN THE TRAILERS), just go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092790/Inscryption/">buy it</a> and play it. I promise you that this is an
            experience you'll want to go into completely blind.<br />
            Anyways, I'd imagine this is more than enough information, but if I think of anything else I'll update this page (or whenever the next hyperfixation comes
            around, I wonder what that'll be). If you read all of this, thanks for willingly subjecting yourself to this massive rambling. I hope you enjoy the site!
