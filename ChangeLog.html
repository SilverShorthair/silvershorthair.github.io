 </p>
<h2>10/12/2022 - Overhaul of the website homepage (Overhaul Update)</h2><br>
The website's homepage is remade to better fit what I want for the site, but it's still a work in progress. Here's a list of new things about the website:
<ul>
<li>I added a logo to the website. I downloaded a version of Blender from 2003 to make it for authenticity.</li>
<li>Removed all the cryptic non-canon stuff about Cat Paper being some ancient demon.</li>
<li>Added a placeholder section to the site at the top. Still not sure what I'll do with it.</li>
<li>Added a dedicated section for my social medias, as opposed to just at the very bottom of the website.</li>
<li>Added Ad 1.gif (WARNING: YOUR SILVERS ARE OUTDATED).</li>
<li>Added a favicon.</li>
<li>Added the fake hit counter to do a joke with it. Still not sure what I'll do.</li>
<li>Copied the Reviews & Awards section from the old website, but removed the review which was just all of the <a href="https://miagaming.itch.io/findthesilver">Find The Silvers</a> comments.
<li>Added The Rat I Do Not Like.</li>
</ul>
The original homepage has been retired, but still exists at <b>[omitted]</b>. This very change log was actually made in this update. It's still unfinished though. I'll update this later and then log that update here.<br>
<h2>GOD DAMN IT THE LOGO GOT MESSED UP (Logo Fix)</h2>
<img src="ChangeLog Images/Broken logo.png" width="20%"><br />
<h2>10/27/2022 - A bunch of stuff so it's sorta hard to summarize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfH4XV7G4Z-bd4f7yJeTv-A" target="_blank"><abbr title="Thanks to Skysupercharged for the name">(Joseph Update)</abbr></a></h2>
<p>
So I sorta just added a lot this update. Let me go through the list:
<ul>
    <li>Added QuerkyAd.png to the homepage.</li>
    <li>Added The long Silver ad to the homepage. Only the long Silver ad appears in the area where the long Silver ad is. Do not try to repeatedly reload the homepage in an attempt to see anything other than the long Silver ad where the long Silver ad is.</li>
    <li>Received reviews from Skysupercharged, Oli, HiyaDerred, wolfdragon245, gorb<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a>]</sup>, and Hanzo.</li>
    <li><details><summary>Made new favicons</summary><p><img src="Favicons/SmallSilver.png"><img src="Favicons/WrittenSilver.png"><img src="Favicons/DisappointedSilver.png"><img src="Favicons/AboutSilver.png"><a href="https://silvershorthair.github.io/TheRuins"><img src="Favicons/RuinsSilver.png"></a></p></details></li>
    <li>Lost track of The Rat.</li>
    <li>Added a stylesheet.</li>
    <li>Added a header and buttons to help navigate the website.</li>
    <li>Added AboutMe.html.</li>
</ul>
There's a bunch of unfinished stuff, but it's been a while since the last update, so I've decided this is good enough for now.
</p>
<h2>10/31/2022 - Not The Halloween Update (Quick Update)</h2>
<p>
Got bored and added stuff.
<ul>
    <li>Changed the placeholder text on the homepage to instead be an about page for the website.</li>
    <li>Added a footer.</li>
    <li>Updated metadata.</li>
    <li>Added a Portal 2 button.</li>
</ul>
    </p>
    <h2>11/21/2022 - Running out of names for updates (Quick Update II)</h2>
<p>
Placeholder text
<ul>
    <li>Added the Quick Update to the Change Log.</li>
    <li>Added a review from Flippity "Fiddlesticks" Jibbet.</li>
    <li>Removed Querky's ad from the homepage and moved it to a currently unused page while I figure out where to put it.</li>
    <li>Updated the copyright symbol to use the entity name.</li>
    <li>Updated the Portal 2 button's CSS.</li>
    <li>Replaced the Social Media section of the homepage with a Links section.</li>
    <li>Updated About Me.</li>
</ul>
</p>
        <h2>11/23/2022 - Added a scrollbar (Fun scrollbar)</h2>
<p>
Added a scrollbar (thanks to <a href="https://scrollbars.matoseb.com/">https://scrollbars.matoseb.com/</a> for the Mac OS 8 scrollbar)
<ul>
    <li>Literally just added a scrollbar.</li>
    <li>I don't know what else you want me to say I added a scrollbar.</li>
</ul>
</p>
        <h2>11/23/2022 - Added Semisol's review (Sandcat)</h2>
<p>
Semisol wanted me to add his review so this update is dedicated to adding his review.
<ul>

    <li>Added Semisol's review.</li>
</ul>
            <h2>12/28/2022 - I added pillarboxes and other stuff (Pillarbox Update)</h2>
<p>
I added pillarboxes to the website, and added a portfolio.
<ul>
    <li>I added some cute little pillarboxes, which are the cute little areas on the sides of the actual content of the website. This is an attempt (not sure how well it worked) of emulating older websites, which sometimes had sidebars, I assume because of 4:3 monitors.
    Unfortunately, the sidebars aren't actually functional, so if you're using a real 4:3 monitor, they'll still be there. They're also not the exact size they probably should be. Regardless, I think they make a nice addition to the site.</li>
    <li>I added a portfolio so that you can now see reasons to hire me for your 3D-modeling needs.</li>
    <li>Added the UnemployedSilver favicon for the portfolio page.<br />
        <img src="Favicons/UnemployedSilver.png" /></li>
    <li>Removed reviews from ReelwebReviews and The Internet Website Page Of The Year Awards<br />
    <li>Added a review from an anonymous individual.</li>
    <li>Moved Querky's ad to Bears.html</li>
</ul>
</p>
            <h2>1/1/2023 - Pronouns Update (Silver She/Her Update)</h2>
<p>
Changed pronouns to she/her. That's all.
</p>
            <h2>1/25/2023 - Made review submission fancier (Review Page Update)</h2>
<p>
Added the <a href="https://silvershorthair.github.io/review">review submission center</a> (NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL), among other things.
    <ul>
        <li>Added the review submission center</li>
        <li>Added reviews from Sand and Jenko.</li>
        <li>Added <a href="https://dev.to/oskarcodes/send-automated-discord-messages-through-webhooks-using-javascript-1p01">this tutorial</a> to the credits.</li>
        <li>Updated my portfolio.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
    </p>
            <h2>1/25/2023 - Got rid of the webhook (Review Page Update Epilogue)</h2>
