<h2>10/12/2022 - Overhaul of the website homepage (Overhaul Update)</h2><br>
The website's homepage is remade to better fit what I want for the site, but it's still a work in progress. Here's a list of new things about the website:
<li>I added a logo to the website. I downloaded a version of Blender from 2003 to make it for authenticity.</li>
<li>Removed all the cryptic non-canon stuff about Cat Paper being some ancient demon.</li>
<li>Added a placeholder section to the site at the top. Still not sure what I'll do with it.</li>
<li>Added a dedicated section for my social medias, as opposed to just at the very bottom of the website.</li>
<li>Added a fake ad.</li>
<li>Added a favicon.</li>
<li>Added the fake hit counter to do a joke with it. Still not sure what I'll do.</li>
<li>Copied the Reviews & Awards section from the old website, but removed the review which was just all of the <a href="https://miagaming.itch.io/findthesilver">Find The Silvers</a> comments.
<li>Added The Rat I Do Not Like.</li>
The original homepage has been retired, but still exists at <b>[omitted]</b>. This very change log was actually made in this update. It's still unfinished though. I'll update this later and then log that update here.
