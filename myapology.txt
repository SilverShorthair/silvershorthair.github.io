Recently, I accused the Grinch of being late to
the update, and very harshly condemned him.
The Grinch community brought to my attention that
in actuality the Grinch's absence was due to a
capitalization mistake on my part, and I was unjustly
criticizing him for something which was my fault.
Thankfully, the Grinch was very understanding,
and was willing to forgive me for what I said, and
in the end he showed up for the update. I am incredibly
thankful to both you all and The Grinch community
for holding me accountable. I strongly regret what
I said about the Grinch, and I promise to learn
and grow from this mistake. I know words don't mean
a lot on their own, so I will be donating a percentage
of the profits from this update to Grinch charities.
