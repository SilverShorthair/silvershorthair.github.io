<h2>10/12/2022 - Overhaul of the website homepage (Overhaul Update)</h2><br>
The website's homepage is remade to better fit what I want for the site, but it's still a work in progress. Here's a list of new things about the website:
<ul>
<li>I added a logo to the website. I downloaded a version of Blender from 2003 to make it for authenticity.</li>
<li>Removed all the cryptic non-canon stuff about Cat Paper being some ancient demon.</li>
<li>Added a placeholder section to the site at the top. Still not sure what I'll do with it.</li>
<li>Added a dedicated section for my social medias, as opposed to just at the very bottom of the website.</li>
<li>Added Ad 1.gif (WARNING: YOUR SILVERS ARE OUTDATED).</li>
<li>Added a favicon.</li>
<li>Added the fake hit counter to do a joke with it. Still not sure what I'll do.</li>
<li>Copied the Reviews & Awards section from the old website, but removed the review which was just all of the <a href="https://miagaming.itch.io/findthesilver">Find The Silvers</a> comments.
<li>Added The Rat I Do Not Like.</li>
</ul>
The original homepage has been retired, but still exists at <b>[omitted]</b>. This very change log was actually made in this update. It's still unfinished though. I'll update this later and then log that update here.<br>
<h2>GOD DAMN IT THE LOGO GOT MESSED UP (Logo Fix)</h2>
<img src="ChangeLog Images/Broken logo.png" width="20%"><br />
<h2>10/27/2022 - A bunch of stuff so it's sorta hard to summarize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfH4XV7G4Z-bd4f7yJeTv-A" target="_blank"><abbr title="Thanks to Skysupercharged for the name">(Joseph Update)</abbr></a></h2>
<p>
So I sorta just added a lot this update. Let me go through the list:
<ul>
    <li>Added QuerkyAd.png to the homepage.</li>
    <li>Added The long Silver ad to the homepage. Only the long Silver ad appears in the area where the long Silver ad is. Do not try to repeatedly reload the homepage in an attempt to see anything other than the long Silver ad where the long Silver ad is.</li>
    <li>Received reviews from Skysupercharged, Oli, HiyaDerred, wolfdragon245, gorb<sup>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a>]</sup>, and Hanzo.</li>
    <li><details><summary>Made new favicons</summary><p><img src="Favicons/SmallSilver.png"><img src="Favicons/WrittenSilver.png"><img src="Favicons/DisappointedSilver.png"><img src="Favicons/AboutSilver.png"><a href="https://silvershorthair.github.io/TheRuins"><img src="Favicons/RuinsSilver.png"></a></p></details></li>
    <li>Lost track of The Rat.</li>
    <li>Added a stylesheet.</li>
    <li>Added a header and buttons to help navigate the website.</li>
    <li>Added AboutMe.html.</li>
</ul>
There's a bunch of unfinished stuff, but it's been a while since the last update, so I've decided this is good enough for now.
</p>
<h2>10/31/2022 - Not The Halloween Update (Quick Update)</h2>
<p>
Got bored and added stuff.
<ul>
    <li>Changed the placeholder text on the homepage to instead be an about page for the website.</li>
    <li>Added a footer.</li>
    <li>Updated metadata.</li>
    <li>Added a Portal 2 button.</li>
</ul>
    <h2>11/21/2022 - Running out of names for updates (Quick Update II)</h2>
<p>
Placeholder text
<ul>
    <li>Added the Quick Update to the Change Log.</li>
    <li>Added a review from Flippity "Fiddlesticks" Jibbet.</li>

    <li>Updated the copyright symbol to use the entity name.</li>
    <li>Updated the Portal 2 button's CSS.</li>
