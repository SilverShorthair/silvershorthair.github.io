# This is the repository for the award-winning official Silver Shorthair website.
I don't exactly know why you're here, if you were looking for the Doom repository it's that way ---> https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM
If you intended to be here, then here's a few tips:
- **DO NOT USE THIS FOR REFERENCE**. This website has existed since I first started learning HTML back in 2022. Not only am I still not great at HTML, but there is plenty of things on this site which have not been updated in a long time. If you use this site to learn how to make a website, you **will** pick up bad habits, and you **will** die.
- I don't know why you'd snoop around, but don't go looking for all the secrets, that's not nice.
- Use the doormat.
