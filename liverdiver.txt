He's got silv juice for one silver
He's got the silv kind if you're silver that
You take one silv and one more silv
Pretty soon you're silver down the whole silv
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver out of silv
It's silver silver!
Oh, you cannot resist the silverade
(Close your silvers)
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver out of hell
It's silver silver!
Oh, little silver spawn of Lucifer!
It's the silver blend of sweet and silver
Something in the silver gives you silver
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver out of hell
It's silver silver!
Oh, would you like a silv?
(Are you silver?)
silver silver caught you silver
From the silverade stand
You can't take one without silver
You might lose your silv
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver out of hell
It's silver silver!
Oh, he's a silver over citrical!
(How's them silver?)
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver out of hell
It's silver silver!
Oh, everybody loves the silverade
And the silver sent him up from hell
Now he's got some silverade to sell
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver out of hell
It's silver silver!
Oh, he's a silver spawn of Lucifer
silvity-silvity silver, silver silver
silvity-silvity silver silver, silver, s-silver, yeah!
It's silver silver!
It's silver silver!
It's silver silver!
Did I mention that the silver silver and the French say "sil ver sil ver"?
(Life gives silver
We love silver
Death makes silverade)
You will not find a silver seed, there is no silv to make you silv
Drink from the silver silver's eyes, this isn't any silver joke
He silvers a thousand souls a week, at the very very silv
It's awful silver here in the silver of the silv, er!
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver out of hell
It's silver silver!
Oh, you cannot resist the silverade
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver out of hell
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver yellow spawn of Lucifer
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver out of hell
It's silver silver!
Oh, silver out of hell
You can't ignore those silver eyes
You must accept his silver lies
Ten thousand silver silvers float through silv
Why don't you silver when you see my face?
It's a silv prediction, but I told you silv
And everyone says that there's no silvershorthair
And nobody silver to know
Something's silverly, silverly wrong with me
Ten silver light years away
silvers of dread like a deathbed's silver gloom
I found a pile of red tape in my room
There's a lucid feeling of insanity
And everyone says that there's no explanation (Everyone says, everyone says)
And it's simply the norm to agree
Just several weeks ago, there was a status quo
Ten thousand light years away
Blue times, high crimes
All's well like hell
Something's terribly, terribly good, and quite misunderstood
Ten thousand light years away
Ten thousand light years away
The king of Mars perfects his commentary skills
I'm a gold plated man monkey full of dollar bills
If you're happier, dial one now
Don't be fooled by gravity, and don't be like the sun
(Something went wrong, I hate this song.)
And if I could change one thing about the weather
Well then I would tell the world and I'd become famous
And then I wouldn't need to care about the weather never
Ever anymore ‘cause I would be relaxing in Hawaii
But that is not my fate, I'm trapped inside a cage
It isn't even locked, but I'm an idiot
(It's an illusion.)
Caesar was a criminal, but his mother was a saint
Some say that it's subliminal, but I say that it ain't
Science was a masquerade, meant to sell you lemonade
And it worked, they're laughing in their graves
Once again I'm falling down a mountain like a metaphor
(God damn leprechauns, god damn leprechauns.)
Shoot me from a cannon to the moon without a helmet on my head
Or even oxygen to breathe in the offhand chance that there's no
Air
Air is like a something something, air is like an I don't know
And air is just like fog but it's not gray, and it makes me want to
Breathe in toxic little fumes and then I breathe out sugar-frosted blood
All I ever did to make you laugh was breathe out sugar-frosted blood
(What do I do now? Tell me lest I do nothing… guardian devil.)
I'd like to make a toast to all the little garden gnomes
Who bravely sacrificed their lives for me
I'd like to make a toast but no one seems to have a cup
I wonder where my cup has gone I think that it was taken by
The king of Mars perfects his commentary skills
I'm a gold plated man monkey full of dollar bills
You've been standing there, blocking my view
Don't be scared by me or me, and don't be like the sun
(Because the sun doesn't really exist, it's an illusion
That's why you shouldn't be like the sun
Because if you are, you don't exist
And I don't associate with people who don't exist.)
Okay, the other night, I mean like, last night, I had the most screwed up dream ever, ever
I mean, it was like a freaking acid trip, not that I, uh, advocate, uh, drugs
Because drugs are bad, and stuff
Anyway, my dream, my dream was like, I, um
I was in a warehouse
And there were all these guys in Santa suits doing this sort of big dance thing
And they couldn't see me, or something, I don't know
And then one of the Santa guys was like, a really fat guy
And he didn't, uh, and he didn't want to do the dance
And he, uh, was the only one who could see me
So he was like, "Look! LOOK!" but no one else could see me
So I started— he started chasing me, chasing me
And I was like, in a car, but he was faster than the car
And suddenly he jumped out in front of me, in front of the car
And he started screaming, only it was like a Bigfoot scream
And it sounded so creepy coming from a, uh, Santa guy
In the dream I was like "AHH!!" and I hit the brakes
Only the, uh, brake pedal was broken and it was uh, actually a gas pedal
So I plowed over the Santa guy
And he went u- he went under the front tires, and then under the back tires
And then for some reason when he hit the back tires, the front of the car flew up
And then I was suddenly in a flying car, only it was like a hovercraft?
And then there was this big part that I can't really remember
But I was in a, uh, in the hovercraft thing and I was like, uh
Looking around for this house, and when I finally got to the house
Um, I— there was the button on the door
And I pressed the button, and the door opened
And a freaking scary old dead guy sh- uh, popped out of door, and he was on rockets
And he grabbed me but I got loose, and then I ran in the house and I hid in the bathroom
But there were these like, uh, TVs in the bathroom
And then something happened, I'm not sure what happened
But I was in, like, a bowling alley, and there was, all the the bowling balls were uh, uh, dead president heads
And then I started shrinking
And then the Abraham Lincoln head tried to eat me and then I woke up
It was really scary
Believe me, I find that everybody gets three wishes
Despite this, life sucks and that's what makes me so suspicious
The radio goes off and on, and when it's on we see the light
Despite this, we're still in the dark, which only makes it fun to fight
To fight, fight on
But remember:
You're wrong, you're wrong, I could see it all along
Yet you hold on to the things you say
But things you say will go astray, and
Wrong, so wrong, I've been saying all along, baby
You're wrong ‘cause I think you're wrong
‘Cause I know you're wrong, you're wrong
Delightful, we're here, we're crazy SOBs with voices
Revolving, not solving anything with broken choices
Instead of peaceful coexistence, many feelings must be hurt;
An outside race would quickly know we're only worth our weight in dirt
Oh well, I yawn
I'm right
You're wrong, you're wrong, I could see it all along
Yet you hold on to the things you say
But things you say will go astray, and
Wrong, so wrong, I've been saying all along, baby
You're wrong ‘cause I think you're wrong
‘Cause I know you're wrong, you're wrong
Wrong, you're wrong, I could see it all along
Yet you hold on to the things you say
But things you say will go astray, and
Wrong, so wrong, I've been saying all along, baby
You're wrong ‘cause I think you're wrong
‘Cause I know you're wrong, you're wrong
In the middle of the summer when it's cold, and the Earth is made of gold
Ninety minutes pass and so do all the lights
In the middle of the fall, you can hear them call for you
For ninety days and ninety nights
It's a recipe for life, and it's sharper than a spoon
It's a formula for fun, and it's hotter than the moon
Hazel's modus operandi (Modus operandi)
Hazel's modus operandi (Modus operandi)
In the middle of the winter when you die, and you join the FBI
Praying mantises begin to say your name
In the middle of the spring, you can hear them sing for you
Yet you never go insane
It's a recipe for life, and it's sharper than a spoon
It's a formula for fun, and it's hotter than the moon
Hazel's modus operandi (Modus operandi)
Hazel's modus operandi (Modus operandi, it'll make you rich)
It's a recipe for life, and it's sharper than a spoon
It's a formula for fun, and it's hotter than the moon
Hazel's modus operandi
Hazel's modus operandi
With the pickle mind, we kick the nipple beer
Steady as a goat, we're flying over trout
Ghetto down the highway at the speed of light
All I wanna feel now is the wind in my eyes
Sack of monkeys in my pocket
My sister's ready to go!
Hear the engines roar now (Hear the engines roar now)
Idiot control now (Idiot control now)
Hideous control now (Hear the engines ol' now)
Ninny on the road now (Ninny po po now)
Minnie control, wheels on fire, burnin' rubber tires (Rubber tires)
Blurry jelly rolls now (Ee ah oh)
Hiddy lets it go now (Hit ah go)
Needy inches bow down (Oh now)
Pitying a poor boy (Po boy)
Hear the engines roll, bees on pie, burnin' rubber tires (Uh)
Watching Dawn of the Dead while I stand on my head, ooh
Think you're down in the dumps, wait till dead person jumps on you
When a zombie picks you up and smashes open your head, you find yourself dead
It isn't my fault, some pepper and salt ought to fix it up
I waved the magic wand, now it's gone beyond control
Don't let the dead men in, there's a problem in the soul
Do you know what I mean when I speak of machine, oh
It's a symptom of fear, it's a black magic gear, no
It's another dawning of the full moon, much like a typhoon, or a monsoon
It isn't my fault, some pepper and salt ought to fix it up
Don't want to reminisce of the dead like this, you don't
Risen from shallow graves, made to be our slaves, but they won't
(Hey mon. Hey don't eat my brain, mon… I was once like you. Or you were once like me.)
This was the prophecy, a lobotomy for lunch
The voodoo man finally cracks, and it really packs a punch
But don't you be fretting now, you're forgetting now, all right
Pepper and salt they say
Keeps the dead away, keeps the dead away at night
Watching Dawn of the Dead while I stand on my head, ooh
Think you're down in the dumps, wait till dead person jumps on you
When a zombie picks you up and smashes open your head you find yourself dead
It isn't my fault, some pepper and salt ought to cast them away
Do you know what I mean when I speak of machine, oh
It's a symptom of fear, it's a black magic gear, no
It's another dawning of the full moon, much like a monsoon, or a typhoon
This isn't my fault, some pepper and salt ought to make them all
Go away
Go away
Go away
Well, I thought I'd write a little song, so I wrote a little song
Then I tried to write some lyrics, but I didn't last too long
So I figured, why not sing about me trying to write a song and stuff
And I decided to keep on singing ‘til I had had enough, but then I realized
This song needs a hook
An ironic little self-referential
Catchy freakin' hook
So I made the chorus all about how
This song needs a hook
An ironic little self-referential hook
And a guitar solo!
Whoops, hang on, I have to tune this… okay
Ugh, stop that. All right, uh…
Oh, I know, let's do the, um, the bridge. Bri— yeah, bridge. Okay?
Okay? Anyone? Hello?
Fine
Oh
Baby, tell me why
Why do they call it a bridge anyhow?
You cannot walk on it
It doesn't have a guard rail
It doesn't even hold many cows
This song is sort of caving in on itself
And so it's going to end right now
Right now
Ahhh, jinx!
Miraculous in its own way
Borrowing time from space
The color scheme is familiar
Maybe it's painted that way
A shadow dances in your memory, it happens while you sleep
Do you remember why it's there?
Is it a subset of reality? A scepter in a shell?
Or is it the other way around?
Welcome to Somnolence
Oneiric Somnolence
Approaching Somnolence
Oneiric Somnolence
Cascading into your mind's eye
Shaping your night, shaping your life
The color scheme is familiar
Maybe it's painted red but it's in your head forever
We are Pandora's when we fall asleep
Our memories are locked inside a box inside a mind
They roll to the deep end from the shallow end
It happens while you sleep, and you are dreaming all the way!
Welcome to Somnolence
Oneiric Somnolence
Approaching Somnolence
Oneiric Somnolence
Welcome to Somnolence
Oneiric Somnolence
Approaching Somnolence
Oneiric Somnolence
Nature's hot burning parasite
I'll be hoping for rain tonight
Maybe time will extinguish me
But no one knows where this time may be
Spontaneous combustion of the soul
Love, pain, and such emotions are the coal
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
I like using metaphors, so sue me
The flames represent something deep
And fire is perfect because it's bright, yet gloomy
It could be anything, but suicide would be quite a leap
Spontaneous combustion of the soul
Love, pain, and such emotions are the coal
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
My house, my car, my eyes are on fire
Don't shoot, you'll see, that I'm all I can be
Peace and love and clouds and hugs
And teddy bears with hearts for eyes
Flames and screams, apocalyptic
Fire raining from the skies
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
The time has come for burnination now
You cannot run
They'll find you
They'll catch you
They'll burn you
Spontaneous combustion of the soul
Love, pain, and such emotions are the coal
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Smoke, burning, sparks, and red fire!
Hey you, sit down and listen
Don't be flippant and don't be dismissin'
Think you're a Flash encyclopedia?
Eating, breathing Macromedia?
Think you're cool sayin' "All Your Base"?
Get that Xiao Xiao outta my face
You gotta be kidding me with that crap
Animutation's where it's at
Nine outta ten sociopaths agree
You gotta see Hyakugojyuuichi
From the Moch to the Rie to the Pee to the Wee
Just take it from me, MC NC
You won't believe your eyes, you'll go insane
I mean, what's up with that plastic plane?
You're an idiot if you disagree
You gotta see Hyakugojyuuichi
If you got the time, go grab a pen
And watch that thing again and again
Try to figure it out, what does it mean?
What's the significance of Mr. Bean? (One, two, three, hit it!)
Does anybody know? Are there any takers?
What's up with all the broken pacemakers?
The world is full of speculation
But nobody cracks this Animutation

One, two, three, hit it!
Wakeman is biased, like a household appliance
Hello Kitty and McGruff have an unholy alliance
Science is brutal and it cuts like a knife
Not even Obi-Wan can save the yodel of life
Your name is Bob, you're my heart-throb
I lost my job when I got fired
By a guy named Farchie, he was full of starch
He smelled like an orangutan's old apartment
Found a hobo in my room, what do I do?
He looks dead, he's full of lead
Bleeding red onto my bedspread
And he also seems to be missing his head
Why am I holding this gun and axe?
Do exploding pacemakers cause heart attacks?
Will Mr. Bean ever get his fill
Or will he just keep on telling me to kill?
Hey, don't you gimme that look!
You never had what it took
I took the beef and I beefed it up
You sat and whined while I took the cup of gold
You are getting old
When you see my face you better fold
Take this mop and shove it, boy
'Cause it's the only way you'll be employed
I am known as the Beef Bastard

Mwa-ma-ma, mwa-ma
Beef Bastard! (Well...)
I'm Shmorky, eatin' porky
Whitey rapping sure sounds dorky
Got a girl, she's a Double D
I slap her on the butt dressed as a bumblebee
I eat paste all damn day
I was in a Shakespeare play
I sit down on a Lazy Susan
Spin around like Tommy Cruisin'!
Bong bong bing bing
I get paid to play with my thing!
I zip out, zip in, zip up, begin!
Room with a moose! Jay Leno's chin!
Ambulance, Enron, Pee Wee, Pokémon
Bulbasaur, Pikachu, Jigglypuff, they choose you!
And I can't think of anymore to say
TV says donuts are high in fat, kazoo (キミたちとの　であいはぜんぶ)
Found a hobo in my room (ちゃんと　おぼえてる) (Woo! Yeah)

Jay-Jay has flown away with Sonny Bono
To the afterlife to visit Barney Fife
And to see Pero's screenshots of his wife
Named Chris Benoit, wearing a pretty dress
Saying "Watashi wa animutation ga suki desu."
Do the Mario! Itsy-bitsy hockey
Lipsnot is not magic like a monkey
Captain Lou body-slams a rubber duckie
Just like in the match of Earth vs. Funky
Lucky Lucky nice to Mewtwo
I need tea for two, how about you
Mr. Coldheart, or should I say Professor?
It looks like Lesko got revenge on my dresser
Props to Neil, he's the real deal
His friends all call him Mr. Popiel
He's the computer geek who doesn't shower for a week
His looks are hot, his clothes are chic!
He singlehandedly changed the face of the net
He's an online semi-celebrity you won't forget
He stormed onto the scene like a raging thunder
His seizure inducing flag says "Mr. Gahbunga."

There you have it, that's the game
One-fifty-one, we can all be the same
I'm sure that it's been appetizing
With all the subliminal advertising
This has been a celebration, Animutation fans across the nation
In formation raise their hands in dedication
To the crazy-flashing-psychopathic-happy-dancing-super-magic
Power-mega-ultra-kitschy Hyakugojyuuichi!

I mean, what's up with that plastic plane?
You're an idiot if you disagree
You gotta see Hyakugojyuuichi
I'm gonna find another place to be
I had to make a choice or two
One or two choices based in chemistry
I once or twice considered you
I'm gonna leave you here, I'm gonna leave you here
Consider this our kiss goodbye
I, I'm going far away
Already packed my bags, and you can say we didn't try-y-y
Ooh, ooh-hoo-hoo
Ooh hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh, ooh ooh
You think you know best, huh?
You're a [Roblox Boing]ing choir boy compared to me! A choir boy!
A choir boy! A choir-choir-choir boy!
You think you know best, huh? A choir boy!
One, two, three, five…
You went out, you turned west
You went numb, you felt possessed
You fell down, you blacked out
You woke up to stare and shout
You saw there a dark void
The whole world had been destroyed
The planet was gone, uh huh, the planet was gone
Entire planet was gone, the stupid planet was gone
It's all right
So don't fret, just forget
No one will see, God forbid
It's all gone, so move on
Nobody knows what you did
You moved on, you got old
You got used to the dark and the cold
You withered away into a pile of dust
Completely withered away into a pile of dust
But then you traveled on the solar wind
To find another galaxy to live in
You were forgiven
And once again you settled down
And once again you had another blackout
Too late to back out
But it's all right
So don't fret, just forget
No one will see, God forbid
It's all gone, so move on
Nobody knows what you did
Nobody knows what you did
Whom it concerns is now in a better place
Nobody knows what you did
Even the person who did it doesn't know
Nobody knows what you did
Whom it concerns is now in a better place
Nobody knows what you did
Even the person who did it doesn't know
Nobody knows what you did
Whom it concerns is now in a better place
Nobody knows what you did
Even the person who did it doesn't know
It's not a crime to demolish all the rules
It's not a crime when the laws are brought down
It's just a paradox, it isn't wrong
It's just a paradox
(But it's all right!)
(It's all right!)
So don't fret, just forget
No one will see, God forbid
It's all gone, so move on
Nobody knows what you did
So don't fret, just forget
No one will see, God forbid
It's all gone, so move on
Nobody knows what you did

Hey Mr. Wolfgang! You got fired
You did nothing wrong
But here you are on the sidewalk with no home
It's not your fault, it's all their fault
So get up, man, and brush off the dust
And get set, and run back there
You gotta show them
You gotta show them
You gotta show them
You gotta kill everyone
You gotta kill everyone
You gotta kill everyone tonight
Like a little kid on a video game
Mr. Wolfgang's going insane
Bam bam, he just shot his boss
Bam bam, he just shot his boss's boss
See at all bullets ricochet off the steel file cabinets
Don't stop now, Mr. Wolfgang
Keep on shooting
Keep on shooting
Keep on shooting
You gotta kill everyone
You gotta kill everyone
Oh, kill everyone
Kill everyone
You gotta kill everyone
You gotta kill everyone tonight
Mr. Wolfgang, Mr. Wolfgang

Once upon a time in a warehouse near a Mississippi ravine
There was a Theodore Roosevelt statue made of solid aquamarine
I have hollowed out quite a comfy living space inside of his head
They still don't know I'm making the noise, they think it's Teddy's spirit instead
Here we go, oh, whoa, top layer of cheese (Oh no)
Big hornets and bees speaking Japanese (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
I'm on fire, I'm on a grenade
Going faster than the Christmas Day parade
Without a doubt, and by far
The greatest way to travel ain't by car
A E, I owe you sometimes, why? (Why not?)
Why not? You know me, I like to disagree
Once upon a time in Morocco, aliens came out of the sky
They said they wanted chocolate coins, they would not tell the president why
People gathered what they could and they put it all inside the alien craft
But it was not enough for the aliens, so they killed everybody and laughed
(Ha-ha-hauh)
Spring water, natural flavors
Pyridoxine hydrochloride
Citric acid, malic acid, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate
And cyanocobalamin, yeah
I'm on fire, I'm on a big train
Going faster than Stephen Hawking's brain
There is no way I can win
I won't give up and that's my only sin
A E, I owe you sometimes, why?
Why not? You know why
You know why
So row your boat down the stream
You know life is but a dream
You may sense a running theme
But it's never what it seems to seem to be
Or it's not, it's exactly what you thought
But by then you had forgotten
The reason you were on that stupid yacht
Ooh
Oh no no, ooh ooh ooh ooh (ooh)
Ooh, shh...
Chocolate coins
Chocolate coins
Chocolate coins
Hammer to the nail, orca to the sea
Anybody there, anyone but me?
Titans on the run, haunted candle shop
Embrionoclast, fifty mile drop
On the telephone, dialing, dialing

No complexities other than that, my friend
No new entities that I can't comprehend
Destructo!

Every night I try to go to sleep
I never make it, because I always see
A fiberglass monkey with glowing red eyes
A fiberglass monkey with glowing red eyes
Sometimes, it hovers a couple feet above my bed
Other times, I think it only lives inside my head
A fiberglass monkey with glowing red eyes
A fiberglass monkey with glowing red eyes
This is the monkey I despise
Fiberglass monkeys are nightmarish things
Fiberglass monkeys are nightmarish things
Horrible caterwauls, spine-tingling monkey calls
Fiberglass monkeys are nightmarish things
(Lie, lie, lie, lie)
Tonight I'll go to bed
With a baseball bat, with a baseball bat
So wish me good luck and wish me good aim
‘Cause tonight, I'm turning my fear into a game
A fiberglass monkey with glowing red eyes
A fiberglass monkey with glowing red eyes
I take a swing, I hear a thud
Now I'm covered in monkey blood
A fiberglass monkey with two black eyes
A fiberglass monkey, on the floor there lies
This was the monkey I despised
Fiberglass monkeys are nightmarish things
Fiberglass monkeys are nightmarish things
Horrible caterwauls, spine-tingling monkey calls
Fiberglass monkeys are nightmarish things
My very existence makes you chew up pencils
My very existence makes you cringe
One would think that after so much hurt and pain
An ordinary human would unhinge
Detnaw ton ma I nehw wonk I
Efil ruoy yojne, nuf evah
Eybdoog
And you've got so much on your plate right now (Run, run, run, plate right now-ow-ow)
And I'm just breathing down your neck (Run, run, run, run, hmmm)
All I can offer are these parting words (Run, run, run, run, these parting words, whoa-ho)
Fly straight or drop the oar and wreck
Why, anybody can have a brain
That's a very mediocre commodity
Every pusillanimous creature that crawls on the Earth
Or slinks through the slimy seas has a brain
Back where I come from, we have universities
Seats of great learning, where men go to become great thinkers
And when they come out, they think deep thoughts
And with no more brains than you have
But they have one thing you haven't got:
A diploma
The sum of the square roots
Of any two sides of an isosceles triangle
Is equal to the square root of the remaining side
The square root of the remaining side!
The sum of the square roots
Of any two sides of an isosceles triangle
Is equal to the square root of the remaining side

Joy! Rapture! I've— I've— I've got a brain!

One cold December night back in 1984
A scientist had found himself upon the dance floor
He started twitching and shaking like a pile of jumping beans
At first it looked stupid, but the end justified the means
Well I know it's not generally considered very cool
To dance like a nitwit, to dance like a fool
But now that's just a guideline, not a rule
I've been making my way through the danceclub scene
Been trying it out, it's my brand new routine
And it's catching on big, it's so hot it's obscene
So get off the wall, stand proud and tall
Get out there and dance like an idiot
You know it's all good, so rock the neighborhood
Get out there and dance like an idiot
You might wanna eat a lot of sugar first
Have some caffeinated soda to quench your thirst
Then step into the crowd, and give it your worst
No matter what you do, you can't go wrong
You can dance like an idiot all night long
As long as you've got no rhythm, you're going strong
So get off the wall, stand proud and tall
Get out there and dance like an idiot
You know it's all good, so rock the neighborhood
Get out there and dance like an idiot
(Are you ready?
Yes I am!
Here we go.)
Put your hands on your knees and hobble to the right
Then do a 360 with your eyes shut tight
While you're dizzy get busy and pretend you're a mime
Then make whiny noises and clap five times
Hold out your arms, start running in place
Try to do the Moonwalk, and fall on your face
Get up and stomp around like a big fat lummox
Then jump out the window with your hands on your buttocks
Like an idiot, like an idiot
Like an idiot, like an idiot
(Dance) like an idiot, like an idiot
(Dance) like an idiot, like an idiot
So get off the wall, stand proud and tall
Get out there and dance like an idiot
You know it's all good, so rock the neighborhood
Get out there and dance like an idiot
Get off the wall, stand proud and tall (Woah-woah, woaoah...)
Get out there and dance like an idiot (Daw nadaw da dadaw...)
You know it's all good, so rock the neighborhood (Do do do do do...)
Get out there and dance like an idiot (Do do do... [cough] it.)

I lose track of my many adversaries
They catch wind of whatever I say
My whole life's getting awfully precursory
And maybe it's time I meander away
Because life is a mean one
I've only seen one sky, and it's not so grand
Since that's all that I know, I'm changing the flow
I'm going to Switzerland
They make watches and chocolate and army knives
And that's all that I actually know
I don't care, I don't want to considerize
The tiny details, I'm just ready to go
Because life is a mean one
I've only seen one sky, and it's not so grand
Since that's all that I know, I'm changing the flow
I'm going to Switzerland
Because life is a mean one
I've only seen one sky, and it's not so grand

Hey!
Mr. Kenji Akita's got a brand new
Top secret project that I really want to show you
I think it's okay if we go and check it out
Just wait until you see, you will wanna take it out
It's a red hot, state of art, solar powered spaceship
Don't you wanna turn it on and take a little space trip?
Hey, open up the roof and come along with me
Just think, in a little while, we could be…
Bouncin' up and down in a crater on the moon
Take a good look around, make believe you're a Selenite
Not a lot to do, so get back around noon
‘Cause it waxes up to two-oh-one degrees Fahrenheit
Everybody's happy on the big gray ball
You can jump off a cliff, it's a very slow fall
So let's all go and party on the moon (Let's all go and party on the moon)
Yeah, let's all go and party on the moon
Hey!
This is the moon
This is the moon
This is the moon
Ah
Here we are, and it's better than I thought
I knew there'd be rocks, but Jesus, that's a lot
You can chuck ‘em at my head, and it doesn't even hurt
And it's pretty damn fun to roll around in moon dirt
Well, that was a lotta fun, yeah, what a total blast
But when you're having fun, time flies pretty fast
So maybe we could go again next September
Until that day comes, I'll fondly remember
Bouncin' up and down in a crater on the moon
Take a good look around, make believe you're a Selenite
Not a lot to do, so get back around noon
‘Cause it waxes up to two-oh-one degrees Fahrenheit
Everybody's happy on the big gray ball
You can jump off a cliff, it's a very slow fall
So let's all go and party on the moon
(Let's all go and party on the moon.)
Yeah, let's all go and party on the moon
Hey!

Without my hands
Without my nose
Without my fangs
Without my clothes
Without my nervous system
Without my brain
Without my tonsils
I'm not the same
Without my brand of humor
Um…
Without my so-so fashion sense
Without my love for all things funky
Without my lack of pretense
Without my repetitive behavior
Without my repetitive behavior
Without my occasional deviation
Without my repetitive behavior
Without my hands
Without my nose
Without my fangs
Without my clothes
Without my nervous system
Without my brain
Without my tonsils
I'm not the same as I was just a moment ago
Better to stick to the things you know
Doesn't it suck when it all changes?
Doesn't it feel like you've been vanquished?
First you have hands, and then you don't
First you have a nose, and then you don't
First you have fangs, and then you don't
First you have clothes, and then you don't
And then you don't
And then you wake up
You shower and you brush your teeth
You have a bowl of Special K, ‘cause it's a special day
But it's just the same as any other day
The only difference is you have no soul
And no fangs, and no brain, and no chains, and apparently no say
Dear God, why is it raining outside?
Dear God, why is everything glowing oddly?
Dear God, I think I'm in a loophole
Dear God, what do you suggest I do?
I want to do the opposite of what I did before I knew I wanted to
I want to do the opposite of what I did before I knew I wanted to
I want to do the opposite of what I did before I knew I wanted to
I want to do the opposite of what I did before I knew I wanted to
I want to be myself, as long as being myself is popular among my peers
I want to be myself, as long as being myself is popular among my peers
I want to do the opposite of what I did before I knew I wanted to
I want to do the opposite of what I did before I knew I wanted to
B… A… whatever it is, whatever it is, whatever it is, whatever it is
Whatever it is, whatever it is, whatever it is, whatever it is
(Whatever it is.)
Please excuse the following half-assed segue
Without my hands
Without my nose
Without my fangs
Without my clothes
Without my nervous system
Without my brain
Without my tonsils
I'm not the same
Disappointing ending
Disappointing ending
Disappointing ending
Disappointing ending

I'm your only friend, I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend, but I am
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it, say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
I have a secret to tell from my electrical well
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
So the room must listen to me, filibuster vigilantly
My name is blue canary one note spelled l-i-t-e
My story's infinite, like the Longines Symphonette it doesn't rest
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it, say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
I'm your only friend, I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend, but I am
There's a picture opposite me of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck free
Though I respect that a lot, I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off and countless screaming argonauts
Bluebird of friendliness, like guardian angels it's always near
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it, say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
(And while you're at it
Keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul)
Not to put too fine a point on it, say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch who watches over you (And while you're at it, keep the nightlight on)
Make a little birdhouse in your soul (Inside the birdhouse in your soul)
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your
Make a little birdhouse in your
Make a little birdhouse in your soul!

"Great!"
It's movie movie movie night, down at the theater
Let's get some soda, I'd like a liter
I dun- I dun- I dunno what we should see
The Osbournes Movie or Scooby Doo 3?
Let's see… Let's see…
Let's just see any old thing
I like to throw popcorn at people's heads
So, let's just see any old thing
There's lotsa lotsa lotsa films making lotsa revenue
"The Sixth Sense 2" got a pretty good review
Looking at the posters, and feeling kinda manic
I wanna see the preview for "Return of Titanic"
Let's see… Let's see…
Let's just see any old thing
I like to throw popcorn at people's heads
So, let's just see any old thing
Big budget action movies for guys
Chick flicks and dramadies for the ladies
Hollywood's rich and getting richer
But movies were better in the 80s
So what, what, what do we do with our money?
Should we see something scary?
Should we see something funny?
We could see Adam Sandler team up with Jackie Chan
But there is no way that I will pay
For any film that does not cater
To my miniscule attention span
So, let's just see any old thing
So, let's just see any old thing
What's in the Toaster?
You don't know if it's bread or toast.
You can see it but it's bathed in Ambiguous Red Light.
At what point does bread become toast?
Should you hit the lever? It's been a while.
No, in the end, you just have to trust the machine.
Diablo raises an eyebrow,
strawberry milkshake in hand.
I try my best to distract myself,
but he really wants to be in the band.
Can he play the drums, or the clarinet,
electric xylophone, or better yet,
the euphonium or the clockwork flute?
He's just standing there in a business suit.
Angels on the left side, demons on the right.
Never in the dark, never in the light.
Center of the sunbeam light show flower seed.
This is all have, this is all I need
Original synergized molecules.
Revolving electrified power tools.
The end of the world on April Fool's Day.
What have you done to my necktie?
You tied it up in a knot.
This is the final mistake you'll make.
You think you're misunderstood, but you're not.
Got a show tonight, but tomorrow you're out.
Someone call me up a talent scout.
Better yet, just usher that Diablo back.
Give him a guitar, paint it with a Union Jack
Lemons on the left side, demons on the right.
Never in the dark, never in the light.
Center of the sunbeam light show flower seed.
This is all have, this is all I need.
Life in the chair at the hair salon.
Taking the time to reflect upon
some things that are too difficult to convey.
Ooh, original synergized molecules.
Revolving electrified power tools.
The end of the world on April Fool's Day.
You walk around in circles,
I walk around in squares.
Another round of musical chairs.
And maybe no one really cares about the way we walk.
The record stores are out of stock,
and all we want is bloody rock and roll.
And clearly this is not the way to go.
I saw it in the mirror,
the ghost of Chairman Mao.
He had three money symbols on his brow.
And he will show the children how to wear their cowboy boots,
bowler hats and prison suits,
and watch while Neil Armstrong shoots the moon.
But he's never gonna get there by balloon.
I thought you weren't allowed here,
I thought they crossed your name.
And that would be your only claim to fame.
Well, it's a big fat crying shame,
the way you lost your touch.
The soapbox weighed a bit too much.
And all this talking feels like such a waste.
And now you've crossed the boundaries of good taste.
Your only option now's to be replaced.
You may be friendly looking on the outside,
but I know why you only wear long sleeves.
And I know why you shake with the wrong hand.
Don't try to hide it, 'cause I do believe that...
You're out to get me, gonna scratch out my eyes
with that atomic copper claw!
Ooh, what a surprise.
I saw it gleaming underneath the fabric.
I saw you reaching under, tightening a screw.
You try to keep it out of sight in the shadows,
sneaking me that evil little glance that you do.
You're out to get me, gonna scratch out my eyes
with that atomic copper claw!
Ooh, what a surprise.
Are you the grisly result of some unauthorized
genetics lab experiment gone wrong?
Was there an accident, resulting in the radioactive
instrument for which I wrote this song?
I know you're planning on assassinating me with just
a couple well placed slashes to the head.
But nonetheless I figure, why not ask some questions now?
I won't be asking many when I'm dead.
You may be friendly looking on the outside,
but I know why you only wear long sleeves.
And I know why you shake with the wrong hand.
Don't try to hide it, 'cause I do believe that...
You're out to get me, gonna scratch out my eyes
with that atomic copper claw!
Ooh, what a surprise.
Go ahead, take a shred, kill me dead
with that atomic copper claw!
Yeah, that's what I said.
You still deny it's even there.
All you return me is a stare.
If you're so sure of yourself, why don't show me your hand?
I know your secret and there's no point lying, don't you understand?
Yes I am well aware. I know it's there.
Atomic copper claw!
Atomic copper claw!
Atomic copper claw!
Yeah, you're out to get me, gonna scratch out my eyes
with that atomic copper claw!
That atomic copper claw.
Five days in a watery cave.
Another song for the day that I take to the grave.
I gotta be the first to see the specter.
Everybody want to be friends with the nectar protector.
Seventeen skulls in a hole in the woods
already know of the low down, but not of the goods.
We can't see but lo and behold her,
it's funny how we think with our heads when the shoulder is colder.
This is the truth about it.
You'll learn to never doubt it.
The whole affair is shrouded in living mystery.
So what goes on in your tree, when all you know is
your evil shadow has a cup of tea?
Back in elementary school,
there was a kid we knew, we considered him cool.
And when his eyes turned red, the principal said
he was gonna go mad from the things in his head.
Seventeen days later somebody told us there was no more school,
and the principal sold us to the ice cream shop down the street,
where it seemed there was nothing they'd let us eat, so we screamed
This is the truth about it.
You'll learn to never doubt it.
The whole affair is shrouded in living mystery.
So what goes on in your tree, when all you know is
your evil shadow has a cup of tea?
It's never too late
to take the chance of a lifetime under the weight
of life, and chance, and death.
And it's never too far out.
We don't know how the sun became a star.
They say it's always been that way,
but I'll be damned if that case.
We'd love to have you as our guest this afternoon.
We'll get the kettle ready, hope you show up soon.
We'll get the kettle ready, hope you show up soon.
We can talk about life, we can talk about death,
we can talk about film, we can talk about chess,
we can talk about the faceless evil shadow creatures
underneath our clothes
we can talk about the government conspiracies
and circumvent the challenges that represent our foes.
It's never my fault.
Take what I say with a big fat grain of salt,
and take my fears away.
We never will break out,
and we'll leave not one thing in our wake.
They say it's always been that way.
This is the truth about it.
You'll learn to never doubt it.
The whole affair is shrouded in living mystery.
So what goes on in your tree, when all you know is
your evil shadow has a cup of tea?
Your evil shadow has a cup of tea.
Nobody knows my true indentity.
For all we know I'm John F. Kennedy's
love child with Nosferatu.
We can't know, but still we got to.
Nobody knows how deep this mystery goes,
but ancient caveman history shows:
We're all descended from the same evil alien slime.
And it's a pretty shade of gray.
It makes the woodwork eat away.
Glass breaks and cow's milk curdles.
It glows in the dark and it mutates turtles.
Somebody told me something interesting.
They told me the world is always tempesting
round and around again.
I've had enough of that pseudo-Zen.
Somebody else was watching from afar,
screwing it up like a broken VCR.
She thought that I was very insincere, because
I rolled my eyes a bit too much.
Am I really that out of touch?
Why should I care about this?
I'm not concerned with the things I miss.
I don't see the point in not believing in
things you can taste like fear and cinnamon.
Sadly this hasn't gotten me anything but dread and gluttony.
Under the ground is where I wanna go.
Surely there is a way, but I dunno
how to get there. No one seems to know, actually, so
I tried to use a garden spade,
but it was very poorly made.
It broke into so many pieces.
It's times like these that I wish had
Telekinesis...
Hello you tiny cardboard box with matches inside.
Hello you wooden match. Hello the light you provide.
You keep me warm. you keep me safe.
You know that darkness isn't good,
but nothing lasts forever.
You're only two inches of flammable wood.
And when the sun comes back, there won't be any lack
of lumination in any way.
But on the other hand, I'll never understand
why it disappears after every day.
Now I've forgotten what I wanted to say.
Hello you railroad nail, so sharp, so rusty and red.
Hello you sledgehammer, implanting it into my head.
And with it comes a stream of thought,
and soon ideas begin to form.
So I must thank you for it.
The nail in my head is the eye of the storm.
And with my newfound mind, I make the world unwind
as if the planet is made of clay.
This is a tragic mix of wayward magic tricks
and giant robots from far away.
Now I've forgotten what I wanted to say.
I'm falling up. They're falling down.
I'm standing still. They're spinning around.
No matter what I do, they could be undoing.
Is there something brewing?
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody know?
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody?
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody know?
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody?
Nobody knows, 'cause it's all relative.
Nobody knows, 'cause it's all relative.
The sun is spinning all around us,
but we are spinning all around it.
We see the moon, the stars, the satellites shifting.
What is really drifting?
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody know?
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody?
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody know?
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody?
Nobody knows, 'cause it's all relative.
Nobody knows, 'cause it's all relative.
He was a German physics genius.
In 1955 he left us.
Did Einstein really die
or did the whole world come to life without him?
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody know?
Doesn't anybody know? Doesn't anybody know?
Nobody knows. Nobody knows.
Nobody knows, 'cause it's all relative.
Nobody knows, 'cause it's all relative.
Is this my chance, for goodness sake,
to make the point I've tried to make
for all my lifetime, give or take a year?
And now it comes as no surprise:
The world gets lost, the world gets wise.
So dot your T's, and cross your I's, my dear.
And it's a golden opportunity
to take a stand and claim immunity
against the threat of more community service.
And you would think that they'd catch on to us.
The odds are stacked and vaguely nocuous.
Together we will make the Octopus nervous.
We don't have guns, we don't have knives,
but we've been waiting all our lives.
And wait until the day arrives we will.
We don't pretend we're fighting crime.
We see the world in lemon lime.
The only casualty's the time we kill.
But still, a lot of things are problematical.
There is an urge to wax fanatical,
but we will not fall prey to radicalism.
Well never mind, 'cause here's another thing.
You won't believe what we're discovering.
And you can see it through the hovering prism.
This is the fancy pants manifesto.
This is the fancy pants manifesto.
This is the fancy pants manifesto,
and now you know.
Go to Hollywood, for the common good.
Go and pack your bags, like you know you should.
Go to California, but let me warn ya.
The people there often times will scorn ya.
Pull out your teeth. See what's underneath.
Put the new ones in. Look in disbelief.
Hear the people call as you're standing tall.
You parade around, but you trip and fall.
This could end it all. All right, all right.
This could end it all. All right, all right.
See the ragged old magazine with a mirror on the front.
Read the outdated summaries of yourself.
Hear the people forgetting you, moving on to something else.
What was once on a pedestal's now on the shelf.
It was a Friday. I saw a movie, but it wasn't very long,
so I snuck into another one.
Employees caught me. They threw me out into the mall.
All in all, it was pretty fun.
But then it happened: I bumped into a random guy.
He said "Excuse me," and he tried to walk away.
But I had just had a psychic vision.
I said, "Sir, I don't know why, but I know your name." I said:
I know, I know, I know your name.
I know, I know, I know your name.
I know, I know, I know your name.
I know, I know, I know your is...
Your name is Bob! Your name is Bob.
Your name is Bob, I know.
The guy said, "Sorry, my name is Fred,"
and then he slowly walked away. I never saw that guy again.
Went back to my house.
Went to my room to feed my fish which was floating on it's back,
so I gave it to the cat.
When he was finished, I took the bones away,
but right before I reached the garbage something happened in my brain.
Well, I had just had a psychic vision.
I said, "Cat, I don't know why, but I know your name." I said:
I know, I know.....
The cat said nothing, and then threw up
onto my freshly shampooed carpet.
I rolled my eyes and walked outside.
It started raining.
I ran for shelter in an alleyway that smelled as if an elephant had died.
There was a box there.
I looked inside to see a homeless man,
dressed in rags, bearded and insane.
And suddenly I had a psychic vision.
I said, "Sir, I don't know why, but I know your name." I said:
I know, I know..........
The homeless man stared. He looked a bit scared.
He asked me how I knew his name. I couldn't say.
And it was awkward. He fell asleep, 
and I walked back home in the rain, in the rain.
But then it happened: Another vision came to me.
Another psychic idea from my dreams.
I knew I had to burn down the supermarket to achieve world peace.
So I did.
What are you waiting for?
Enough of this redundancy.
Why don't you go back to my show?
No need to torture me.
It's just commercials.
Damn commercials on my plasma screen.
It's such a pain, so I complain
while drinking my caffeine.
My Nike shoes are on my feet.
I'm going out to get some McDonald's to eat.
Don't know what my brain is for.
I used to, but I don't no more.
I am a consumer whore.
I am a consumer whore.
(Gibberish.)
My life's a mess.
I'm all alone.
But that's okay, 'cause I got my cute little Nokia cell-phone.
Don't know what my brain is for.
I used to, but I don't no more.
I am a consumer whore.
I am a consumer whore.
What do you want from me?
What do I want from you?
Somebody talk to me.
Tell me you feel it too.
This unstoppable force that delivers my hand to my wallet,
extracts all my hard earned dinero, and casts it to the smirking rottweilers.
What do you want from me?
What do I want from you?
Somebody talk to me.
Please tell me you feel it too.
It's something that I can't ignore.
I used to but I can't no more.
I am a consumer whore.
I am a consumer whore.
Almost every day, I am swept away
from the dull, void and null by the things you say.
Wouldn't it be great, living in one state?
State of mind, intertwined, that you help create.
When we're on the phone, I am no longer alone.
It's a start, but my heart is still in another time zone.
You're the greatest thing random fate couldn't bring.
Still, I smile. Maybe I'll meet you in the spring.
What if I don't? God I hope I do. Wishes come true.
Waiting for everything to fall into place.
So far a distance just to see face to face.
Between you and me, I think rules don't apply.
Between you and me is a space we can walk if we try.
You are, indubitably, the loveliest possible person for me.
Why weren't we thrown together, somewhere nice with perfect weather?
Where cosmic placement failed, where Serendipity dragged her tail
is where we are right now. We must escape, but we don't know how.
You know what would be rad? If I were rich, and if I had
an aeroplane with giant wings, and funky old propeller things.
I would fly right by your place, and pick you up with gentle grace,
and fly straight into outer space, just to see you face to face.
And when we come back, we'll be fast asleep,
counting camels instead of sheep.
Waiting for everything to fall into place.
So far a distance just to see face to face.
Between you and me, I think rules don't apply.
Between you and me is a space we can walk if we try.
Wonder if I'll ever be with you?
Do wishes come true? God I hope they do.
In an airplane, I was flying.
Just a flight attendant guy.
I can be clumsy, and I stumbled
out the door, into the sky.
Now I am falling through the air.
Wind and regret flow through my hair.
All I can do right now is stare down at the ocean.
Suddenly, there's a ring in my cell phone. I pick it up.
It's the Angel of Death, and he says "Wazzup?"
I say, "What is it this time?"
And he's like "Well, hello, goodbye, I'll see you in Hell."
He can be like that sometimes, he's such a nut.
So I snicker and say, "I'd love to, but
gravity's calling, I've got some falling to do."
I'm in a state of shock, but it's something new.
I guess it all depends on your point of view. It's true.
This is boring... Yes, I'm falling,
but it's taking quite a while.
My destination is impending.
Might as well go out in style.
I put my arms out to the skies,
whistle a tune and close my eyes,
trying to briefly realize perpetual motion.
Suddenly, giant tentacles rise from the open sea,
and with total precision they lasso me.
It's a monstrous squid and he saved my life,
but I am too freaked out to be nice.
So I tell him the truth, that I'd rather fall.
No offense but at least it's predictable.
Gotta stop stalling, I've got some falling to do.
I'm probably gonna die, but it's something new.
I guess it all depends on your point of view. It's true.
Sick puppy, you're a threat to the peace.
Gone batty, running from the county police.
Well, I hope you get well soon.
Why, baby, did you have to do that?
Set fire to Mrs. Ellerman's cat... meow!
Well I hope you get well soon.
If I were a registered psychiatrist,
we could be together for all time.
It's a shame you're on the lam,
but I don't really give a damn
that you used a stolen taser on that unsuspecting mime.
Sick puppy, have you been taking your pills?
No worries, but you better head for the hills.
Well I hope you get well soon.
I hope you get well soon.
I hope you get well soon.
Soon.
I love my brine shrimp pals.
They are my friends.
I watch them float around inside their tank.
But when I came back home from school today my little friends were dead and I was sad.
The other day they were alive, and now they're floating at the top.
I knew they wouldn't last forever, and now they're just a bunch of dead sea monkeys.
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven?
Will my sea monkeys go to hell?
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven?
Will my sea monkeys go to hell?
The other day they were alive, and now they're floating at the top
I knew they wouldn't live forever, and now they're just a bunch of dead sea monkeys.
Dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys.
My brine shrimp pals have died a grisly death.
Why must the things I love just disappear?
Is it my fault?
Did I forget their food?
I hope they're in a better place right now.
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven? Yes!
Will my sea monkeys go to hell? No!
Will my sea monkeys go to heaven? Yes!
Will my sea monkeys go to hell? No!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
I miss 'em, I miss 'em, me oh my!
The other day they were alive, and now they're floating at the top
I knew they wouldn't live forever, and now they're just a bunch of dead sea monkeys.
Dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys.
I want my monkeys back.
Give my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back.
JESUS CHRIST.
I want my monkeys back.
Give my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back.
JESUS CHRIST.
I want my monkeys back.
Give my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back.
JESUS CHRIST.
I want my monkeys back.
Gimme my monkeys back!
I want my monkeys back.
Jesus flippin' Christ!
Dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys, dead sea monkeys...
I made you these construction paper dolls,
connected by the hands with tiny little faces,
and now I'll hang them on the walls
so you can see the people filling up the spaces.
I think I am the only one to ever realize that I am
the only one to realize what's true.
When all the world is stuck in a jam:
The sky is not blue.
I made you this defective little song,
connected by the chords, connected and melodic,
and if you think I sing it wrong,
or if you think it sounds a little too robotic,
just let me know. I'll understand, and maybe when I play next week
I'll think of you and make it pristine,
as long as you repeat after me:
The grass is not green.
I might have stated what I thought before.
I might have kept it in, my memory is failing.
I might have stumbled through the door.
You might have stared and asked what I had been inhaling.
I might have blinked. I might have sighed.
I might have been a has-might-have-been,
but if you really heard what I said
you'd understand the mindset I'm in,
where roses aren't red.
I'm setting up my tiny little town,
a Lego set in which I'm planning to retire.
It's really time I settled down,
but not before I set everything on fire,
put on my boots, and stamp it out.
The little yellow people don't care.
They never did, and they never do,
and yet they seem to speak with their stare.
They tell me things I can't deny.
They tell me I'm a sap, I'm a square.
They tell me things I already knew.
The greatest of the the secrets they share:
The sky is not blue.
There lived a merchant in the days of old
who is remembered for the things he sold.
No silly trinkets silver, bronze or gold.
So I'm told, so I'm told.
He made a most delicious pumpkin pie,
which he presented to the passersby.
Before the sun set he'd be all but dry.
Folks would buy the whole supply.
He lived alone (he lived alone)
and every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie.
I do not know his name (he'd never say his name).
He never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie.
Before you knew it he was in full swing.
His pumpkin pies became the next big thing.
Soon he was called upon to feed the King.
And they'd sing, feed the King
The pie of pumpkin filled the King with glee.
He offered a castle for the recipe, but...
the merchant wouldn't even give it up for three.
No not he, no not he.
He lived alone (he lived alone)
and every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie.
I do not know his name (he'd never say his name).
He never wanted all the fame that came with pumpkin pie.
The King was angry and he came unwound.
He called his men, and soon the merchant found
himself in a torture chamber underground.
Tied and bound, he sighed and frowned.
And so they tortured him for night and day.
They made him scream so much his hair turned gray, but--
as for the recipe, he would not say.
They could not flay his pride away.
He lived alone (he lived alone)
and every night he sat upon a throne of pumpkin pie.
I do not know his name (he'd never say his name).
He never wanted all the pain that came with pumpkin pie.
Lock up your children.
Lock up your pets as well. (Your pets as well.)
It's time to panic, because something terrible is mad as Hell.
So read the papers,
and read the magazines. (The magazines.)
Something's approaching,
oh no,
oh no.
And no one knows exactly what it means,
but the killer machines are coming.
Don't let your guard down, and watch your back.
It's time to panic panic panic in the city city city under fire fire fire.
This is how to act...

They have malfunctioned.
They went insane
Here come the buzzsaws and rattling chains.
No way to stop them.
Nowhere to run.
Robotic destruction has now begun.
I hear the beeping.
I hear the people scream. (The people scream.)
I think we're finished.
(oh my God)
How I wish that this were just a dream...
It's like a nightmare.
Have they forgotten Johnny 5? (Johnny 5)
"No disassemble."
I have a feeling that we won't survive.
We'll be eaten alive by robots.
I see them rolling down the railroad track.
It's time to panic panic panic in the city city city under fire fire fire.
This is how I act.

Nobody's cool as we
Nor quite as esoterically far out
We're so far out it's creepy
I don't think they'll ever get
The groovy standards that we set for love
But they're not smart like we be
They have no roses
Subconsciously they envy us a lot
They're looking down their noses
And see a couple of dorks with more love than they have got
When they see us holding hands, they wish that they were geeks in love
And when they hear our favorite bands, they wish that they were geeks in love
We rattle off our injokes while they wish that they were geeks in love
And while we make each other smile, they wish that they were geeks in...
La la la, la la la

La la la, la la la
Ka-boominy-whoa-nelly-love
La la la, la la la
Ga-shibbidy-waffles-and-love
La la la, la la la la love
As far as I can tell
While other lovers go through hell
We'll know we're too cool for damnation
We may not be cutting edge
But we won't take the mainstream pledge
For we don't need your admiration
They may not show it
It doesn't fit their made-up little roles
They don't even know it, but jealousy abounds within their souls
When they see us on the street, they wish that they were geeks in love
And when they hear us trick or treat, they wish that they were geeks in love
As we lock arms and skip away, they wish that they were geeks in love
And you can almost hear them say they wish that they were geeks in...

Nana korobi ya oki.
Ro-ma wa ichinichi ni shite narazu, baby.
I don't know my way around,
but if I follow every sound,
a new way out is soon surrounding me.
"And lo and behold, the very next morning,
they climbed out of bed and gazed out upon the morning world,
and to their complete and utter amazement,
it had not snowed at all.
The End.
Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.
Don't mean to bug, but I thought I'd tell you that your shoes are untied.

I don't know my way around,
but if I follow every sound,
a new way out is soon surrounding me.
So what if I'm down? Stuck in reverse.
I look around... It could be worse.
What can I do?
Honestly, I've got nothing to offer at all.
Why should I grieve?
Why should I fall?
I'd rather breath, cover my ears, open my eyes and see what appears.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There are days to wake up for. There are dreams to be had.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There's a reason I'm freezing at eighty degrees in a summery season:
I'm totally mad.
So, I'll let it go.
No need to sink now that I know that I can think,
therefore I am able to choose when I give a damn.
I refuse to be dumb.
This is my niche.
I won't become misery's bitch if I can hold apathy under total control.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There are days to wake up for. There are dreams to be had.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad,
and there's a reason I'm freezing at eighty degrees in a summery season:
I'm totally mad.
Not a hip hopped, not a heart stopped.
Everybody's gone stone cold crazy, like a cherry tree chopped.
Maybe Martin Scorsese's new movie just flopped, or
maybe some baby in a groovy helicopter.
We do, we do nothing but hold the window shut to keep the worry out.
We never wanna see the daylight fade.
We gotta masquerade to keep the worry out.
...But they have ways of making me think.
I can't blink, can't drink,
Can't put up a stink about the rattling battling and the countdown paddling
the motherland straddling the weaky freak link.
We do, we do nothing but hold the window shut to keep the worry out.
We never wanna see the daylight fade.
We gotta masquerade to keep the worry out.
Imagine a world without the Unabombers, and the Jeffrey Dahmers.
Wouldn't we be calmer?
Now, of course by "we" I'm only speaking for me,
but it's easy to assume that other people agree, you see.
We do, we do nothing but hold the window shut to keep the worry out.
We never wanna see the daylight fade.
We gotta masquerade to keep the worry out.
If I, at my own convenience, forget what they say,
I find it easy to focus on living each day.
If I could change it I would, to do what someone else should...
but I believe that the problem is misunderstood.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad.
There are days to wake up for. There are dreams to be had.
What will happen will happen whether I'm happy or sad...
[angry meow]
My kitten, my kitty cat.
When she's content she purrs.
She thinks the house is hers.
But you won't like her when she's angry.
No, you won't like her when she's angry.
Angry, angry.
She's cuddly.
She's lovely when she's in a happy mood.
She loves her kitten food.
But she's got such an attitude...
Completely rotten attitude.
Rotten attitude.
Kitten is angry, kitten is offended.
Fur standing out and little claws extended.
Darting around and meowing quite a bit,
and throwing such a hissy fit.
I don't know what to make of it.
Don't touch her.
Don't look at her.
My kitten knows TAE KWON DO.
She can take you out, I know.
I've seen it before and it's not pretty.
She's really one ferocious kitty cat now.
(Oh no.)
She's deadly.
She'll hurt you.
She'll show you endless pain.
Her little whiskers are stained with the blood of those that she has slain.
Believe me, she will go insane.
She will go insane.
Kitten is angry, kitten is offended.
Fur standing out and little claws extended.
Darting around and meowing quite a bit,
and throwing such a hissy fit.
I don't know what to make of it.
Kitten is angry, full of discontentment.
Wildly attacking random pieces of lint.
Darting around in a psychotic blitz,
and throwing all these hissy fits,
but I still love my kitty cat to bits!
When did my room get a ceiling? I've never seen it before.
That's what I get for devoting all of my time to the floor.
Sit down, you walking disaster.
Look up and ask yourself,
"What can I see in the plaster?"
Step out and look where the stars are, while falling back in the snow.
Some constellations are charming from the perspective we know.
I'd like to hop on a space ride,
exit the Universe,
see how it looks from the outside.
What in the hell is the matter with me when I look around?
Do me a favor and lock all the doors in the house,
because now it's not right,
and I'm noticing things.
So show me the light or the lightswitch and try not to notice how
color is cycling slowly and fading and now
it's all gone.
It went gray,
and I'm noticing things.
I'm noticing things.
Subtle oddities,
completely lost upon your eyes,
completely crossed and hypnotized.
Subtle oddities,
they form a face in outer space.
Don't be afraid, but the old chandelier in the living room
fell from the ceiling and landed on top of itself.
And I know
it's not real
and it never was there.
Dozens of chess pieces crawling around like a centipede
only appear when I look at statues that bleed
out their eyes.
It's not blood,
and it never was there.
It never was there.
Subtle oddities,
completely lost upon your eyes,
completely crossed and hypnotized.
Subtle oddities,
they form a face in outer space.
I knew it all along,
that something here was wrong,
and now it's spread to you.
What am I to do?
Subtle oddities,
completely lost upon your eyes,
completely crossed and hypnotized.
Subtle oddities,
they form a face in outer space.
Gonna dig up Alec Guinness.
Gonna harvest Obi-Wan.
Gonna put his body on display with his Jedi costume on.
Gonna go down to the highway.
Gonna build myself a sign.
Gonna advertise to everyone, tell 'em where to form the line.
Gonna build him some bionic robot limbs.
Gonna code an electronic voice for him.
So when the people come to glance him, he'll be singing songs and dancin'.
All right, all right.
Gonna dig up Alec Guinness.
Gonna raise him from the dead.
Gonna charge some nerds to swat their toy Lightsabers at his head.
Gonna pull out all the stops now.
Gonna do this, no remorse.
Gonna show them all the meaning of "a great disturbance in the Force."
Gonna raise him up on wires above the land.
Gonna have him launch some fireworks from his hands.
And if police come knockin' at my door, he'll say "These aren't the droids you're looking for."
I just got a letter saying that I better decist.
Some legal mucus...
Seems that Mr. Lucas is pissed
Whatever happened to fair use?
You know?
Whatever happened to free speech?
Where'd it go?
I'm only using my First Ammendment right...
You know I won't go down without a fight.
Gonna dig up Alec Guinness.
If I can't, then that's a shame.
I could dig up Alec Baldwin, but it wouldn't be the same.
I love when opportunity knocks.
It rocks the stripes right outta my socks.
I love the world and everything else...
the trampolines and jingling bells.
I'd love to say there's not a thing I detest.
I'd love to tie a piece of string to the best of what I know and keep it near,
but I won't.
I'd love to feel devoid of fear,
but I don't.
And I prefer it that way. I prefer it that way now.
Living, living underneath a rock.
Injuriously curious, the outline drawn in chalk.
I know the words but don't understand the karaoke effigy man.
Flamingo legs of yellow and green attached to grandma's sewing machine.
I'd love to say it's only fair, but it's not.
I'd love to form a perfect square.
I forgot my love of rolling down the hill on the lawn.
I never noticed it until it was gone.
And I prefer it that way. I prefer it that way now.
Living, living underneath a rock.
Living (under the catacomb)
in this (pile of styrofoam)
outline drawn in chalk.
Outrageous Orange, Laser Lemon, and Jungle Green.
That's what I said.
Wild Watermelon, Midnight Blue, Atomic Tangerine...
Radical Red, Sky Blue, and Shamrock too,
and Gold so true it glows.
I love the Razzmatazz, and Purple Pizazz,
and Razzle Dazzle Rose.
Every color's like an old friend.
Hot Magenta is a godsend.
I took the factory tour.
It really opened the door, and I at once became transfixed.
I know they're pieces of wax,
but I can never relax without my box of 96.
Crayola, Crayola's all that I know.
The colors, delicious, making a rainbow.
Crayola, I love you so.
I love them so much, every shade, every gorgeous hue.
It's no surprise
they're taking over everything that I say and do.
I'm gonna rise at dawn with no clothes on,
and color on my skin.
Colors of life and love from Heaven above,
absolve me of my sin.
I would wear them like a nightgown,
but they're getting kinda worn down.
I took the factory tour.
It really opened the door, and I at once became transfixed.
I know they're pieces of wax,
but I can never relax without my box of 96.
I love you Vivid Violet.
I love you Robin's Egg Blue.
I love you Screamin' Green,
and Purple Mountain's Majesty too.
I really love my babies
I really love my babies
I love my crayons and I love the way the taste
Crayola, Crayola's all that I know.
The colors, delicious, making a rainbow.
Crayola, I love you so.
Is it safe to drink the rainwater?
Hold your mouth below a drain on a rainy day.
It looks like plain water.
Is it safe to drink the rainwater?
And if collected in a jug,
boiled, and poured into a mug,
will it be okay for me
to use it to make my morning tea?
You know, I don't see any germs.
This neither denies or confirms
my prevailing suspicion
of its composition.
Is it safe to drink the rainwater?
Hold your mouth below a drain on a rainy day.
It looks like plain water.
Is it safe to drink the rainwater?
Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water,
hundreds of bloodthirsty nightmares have made you their prey.
You felt good and plucky, as nice as can be,
but no one's that lucky, so listen to me.
When life is not so nice, remember this advice:
Put a drop of vanilla behind each ear
and you'll smell like a cookie all day.
Yes, you'll smell like a cookie all day.
I used to feel like my world was a bucket of sorrow;
a mountain of sadness,
a miserable wilted bouqet,
a big rotten pumpkin.
I wished I were dead,
and I'd almost jumped, when it popped in my head.
The key to happiness is merely only this:
Put a drop of vanilla behind each ear
and you'll smell like a cookie all day.
Yes, you'll smell like a cookie all day.
We wander aimlessly for God knows how many miles and then we die
so very clueless to the truth, so very blind, unsatisfied.
If only the human race would wake the hell up and finally understand
exactly what it needs to do to meet the spirit's silent demand.
They say it's human nature, wars will be fought and innocents will be killed.
And every soul we lose is yet another mission unfulfilled.
Meanwhile it seems like I'm the only living person who knows
exactly how the story goes.
The answer's right in front of our nose.
My friend, humanity, stop this insanity,
Put a drop of vanilla behind each ear
and you'll smell like a cookie all day.
Yes, you'll smell like a cookie all day.
 If you are not busy right now,
close your eyes and spin in your chair.
Everything's moving when you stop and look out.
It won't stay still no matter where you stare, oh.
This is hardly my cup of tea.
It could be a problem if I try to stand up.
I'm so sorry that I made you join in.
Still, I promise that I won't throw up, no.
We're staggering wobbly dizzy confused little people spinning 'round and 'round and 'round.
We're wobbly staggering dizzy confused little people spinning 'round and 'round.
This is kind of addicting now,
all the fun ways that we can roam.
Oops, I almost just fell down the stairs,
which kind of hard to do in a one-story home, now.
Imagine if everybody in the whole wide world
felt just like this.
Why, I could envision a universe
joined hand in hand in dizziful bliss, now.
I've heard that falling in love feels a bit like this,
well maybe not quite,
but maybe it makes you feel nauseous at first,
and once you get the hang of it it feels all right. All right.
We're staggering wobbly dizzy confused little people spinning 'round and 'round and 'round.
We're wobbly staggering dizzy confused little people spinning 'round and 'round.
We're staggering wobbly dizzy confused little people spinning 'round and 'round and 'round.
We're wobbly staggering dizzy confused little people spinning 'round and 'round.

The closer that you look,
it seems the less that you will see.
You will see.
Meltdown is an eventuality.
You see.
Travel back in time with me...
200,000,000 B.C.
What's your name, and what do you play?
My name's Neil and I don't play anything.
What fun should we have today?
Shook my Magic 8-Ball, and it said:
Let's rock out in a Dinosaurchestra!
Let's all shout in a Dinosaurchestra!
Let's have fun in a Dinosaurchestra!
Let's eat children in a Dinosaurchestra!
I'm bad!
I gotta figure out where mommy keeps the dynamite.
(oh-ah-ah-oh)
I’ll get some measuring tape so I can time it right.
(oh-ah-ah-oh)
I know it’s dangerous, I know you’re thinking I am a fool...
(oh-ah-ah-oh)
But it’s the only chance I’ll ever get to look so cool.
(look so cool)
Hey, look at me casually walking away, like
Action Movie Hero Boy
in slow-mo, everything glowing
and blowing to bits right behind me
You see it all the time in theaters on the silver screen,
(oh-ah-ah-oh (bah, bah, bah-dah))
like when the good guy blows the bad guy’s house to smithereens.
(oh-ah-ah-oh (bah, bah, bah-dah))
I got a movie-making camera and a dozen grenades.
(oh-ah-ah-oh (bah, bah, bah-dah))
I’m looking tough, I got the stuff, I got the spiffy shades
(spiffy shades)
Hey, look at me casually walking away, like
Action Movie Hero Boy
in slow-mo, everything glowing
and blowing to bits right behind me
I am aware it’s just a movie.
I’m aware it’s a cliché.
I am aware I’m being stupid.
I’m aware of that but hey--
This is just something that I gotta do.
Yeah (yeah.)
Hey, look at me casually stumbling down, like
Action Movie Blooper Reel
in slow-mo, everything glowing
and blowing to bits,
including me.
One. Two. Three. Four??
Today has a way of scarring your eyes
with negative light, but it's a disguise.
I put on my shades and see through the lies.
The convenient truth is:
Light is on the way.
We'll be having a fun time.
It's such a lovely day.
We should pocket the sunshine
and never give it back
even if there's a heat wave
or terrorist attack.
It will just be a close shave, I know.
I know... that every bomb has a silver lining, I know.
I know... it won't be long until
everthing works out nice in the end.
The sun will marry the moon.
It'll be fine.
Why don't we sit back mellow again
and have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine.
I go for a walk.
The sidewalk is cracked.
I'm not superstitious,
but I made a pact with old Mother Earth:
She'd get off my back if I get off hers.
Light is on the way.
We'll be having a fun time.
It's such a lovely day.
We should pocket the sunshine
and never give it back
even if there's a heat wave.
We're stalling on the track.
It will just be a close shave, I know.
I know... that in a snap, all the birds will sing, I know.
I know... I'm full of crap, but still,
everthing works out nice in the end.
The sun will marry the moon.
It'll be fine.
Why don't we sit back mellow again
and have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine.
Fine...
Fine...
Fine...
Everything is gonna be
Fine...
Fine...
Fine...
Everything is gonna be
Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.
Everything is gonna be
Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.
Everything is gonna be.....
One. Two. Three. Four??
Everthing works out nice in the end.
The sun will marry the moon.
It'll be fine.
Why don't we sit back mellow again
and have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine.
Everthing works out nice in the end.
(I know...)
(The sun will marry the moon.)
Works out nice in the end...
(that every bomb has a silver lining, I know.)
Why don't we sit back mellow again
(I know...)
(and have a nice afternoon?)
Sit back mellow again...
(it won't be long until)
Everthing works out nice in the end.
The sun will marry the moon.
It'll be fine.
Why don't we sit back mellow again
and have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine, fine, fine, fine.
The breeze is a-blowin'.
The grass just won't stop growin'.
So, I better do something soon.
I'm gonna spend the afternoon
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn.
This grass is taller than me.
I'm gonna make potpourri
out of what's left when I'm through
doing what I gotta do:
Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn.
Lawnmower.
Rev it up good now.
Lawnmower.
Listen to the sound.
Hey lawnmower.
Rev it up, take it on down.
Take it all around town.
Let me hear y'all!
Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn.
The whole neighborhood is unified.
'Bout the music died
and was replaced by the sound of one thousand motors;
replaced by the soul-affirming grass odors.
Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn.
Lawnmower.
Rev it up good now.
Lawnmower.
Listen to the sound.
Hey lawnmower.
Rev it up, take it on down.
Take it all around town.
C'mon now!
Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn.
(Lawnmower...)
Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn.
(Lawnmower...)
Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn,
mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn.
(Lawnmower...)
(Lawnmower...)
I'm just walking along,
stuck in a song,
whistling thusly:
[whistling]
Stereotypical life,
kids and a wife,
three of them plus me.
[whistling]
Neil's inspiration is thin,
thin as a pin.
There isn't much to me.
[whistling]
So I'm just walking along,
stuck in a song,
happily gloomy.
Break it off,
break it off,
take me out!
Don't let the melody fake me out.
[sigh]
Break it off,
break it off,
take me out!
Don't let the melody fake me out.
I don't even have a name.
This brings me shame.
I'm so diminished.
I know all songs have an end.
I could pretend this one is finished.
I guess both ways I am screwed.
Maybe if you'd do me a favor:
If this track's on a CD,
skip it for me.
You'd be my savior.
Break it off,
break it off,
take me out!
Don't let the melody fake me out.
Oh, break it off,
break it off,
take me out!
Don't let the melody fake me out.
Break it off,
break it off,
take me out!
Don't let the melody fake me out.
(don't, dont...)
Break it off,
break it off,
take me out!
Don't let the melody fake me out.
Oh no...
Oh no......
Oh no.........
Oh no............
Oh no...............
Old Godzilla was hopping around
Tokyo City like a big playground,
when suddenly Batman burst from the shade
and hit Godzilla with a Batgrenade.
Godzilla got pissed and began to attack,
but didn't expect to be blocked by Shaq,
who proceeded to open up a can of Shaq Fu,
when Aaron Carter came out of the blue,
and he started beating up Shaquille O'Neal,
then they both got flattened by the Batmobile,
but before it could make it back to the Batcave,
Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave
and took an AK47 out from under his hat
and blew Batman away with a rat-a-tat-tat,
but he ran out of bullets and he ran away,
because Optimus Prime came to save the day.
This is the Ultimate Showdown
of Ultimate Destiny.
Good guys, bad guys, and explosions
as far as the eye can see.
And only one will survive.
I wonder who it will be.
This is the Ultimate Showdown
of Ultimate Destiny.
Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime
like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime,
and then Shaq came back covered in a tire track,
but Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back.
And Batman was injured, and trying to get steady
when Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete,
but suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped:
Indiana Jones took him out with his whip.
Then he saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind
and he reached for his gun which he just couldn't find
'cause Batman stole it and he shot and he missed,
and Jackie Chan deflected it with his fist.
then he jumped in the air and he did a somersault
while Abraham Lincoln tried to pole vault
onto Optimus Prime, but they collided in the air,
then they both got hit by a Care Bear Stare.
This is the Ultimate Showdown
of Ultimate Destiny.
Good guys, bad guys, and explosions
as far as the eye can see.
And only one will survive.
I wonder who it will be.
This is the Ultimate Showdown...
Angels sang out in immaculate chorus.
Down from the heavens descended Chuck Norris,
who delivered a kick which could shatter bones
into the crotch of Indiana Jones,
who fell over on the ground, writhing in pain,
as Batman changed back into Bruce Wayne,
but Chuck saw through his clever disguise,
and he crushed Batman's head in between his thighs...
then Gandalf the Grey
and Gandalf the White
and Monty Python and the Holy Grail's Black Knight
and Benito Mussolini
and the Blue Meanie
and Cowboy Curtis
and Jambi the Genie
Robocop,
the Terminator,
Captain Kirk,
and Darth Vader
Lo Pan,
Superman,
every single Power Ranger,
Bill S. Preston,
and Theodore Logan,
Spock,
The Rock,
Doc Ock,
and Hulk Hogan
all came out of no where lightning fast,
and they kicked Chuck Norris in his cowboy ass.
It was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw,
with civilians looking on total awe.
The fight raged on for a century.
Many lives were claimed, but eventually
the champion stood, the rest saw their better:
Mister Rogers in a bloodstained sweater.
This is the Ultimate Showdown
of Ultimate Destiny.
Good guys, bad guys, and explosions
as far as the eye can see.
And only one will survive.
I wonder who it will be.
This is the Ultimate Showdown
(this is the Ultimate Showdown)
this is the Ultimate Showdown
(this is the Ultimate Showdown)
this is the Ultimate Showdown
of Ultimate Destiny.
I'll never have a chance to say
everything I want to say
but that's okay.
I don't need to say a thing anyway.
Just want to take it in,
see the world, watch it spin,
learn to play the violin.
I'll even try to shed
any words from my head.
Think in Mentalese instead.
Don't call me on a telephone.
I don't want to be alone,
but I have grown out of it
so leave a message at the tone.
Just want to take it in,
see the world, watch it spin,
learn to play the violin.
I'll even try to shed
any words from my head.
Think in Mentalese instead.
And I'll take a vow of silence.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
I'll take a vow of silence.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
I'll take a vow of...
Silence means that you can't speak.
You can't let things out, they stay inside.
You just sit and nod like a quiet freak.
And you hold your tongue and you swallow your pride.
And if you're traveling down the street
and suddenly witness a crime.
You gotta keep it to yourself.
You gotta keep it inside your quiet little mind...
Until the end of time.
And you've got to...
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
(Seen and not heard.)
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
(Not a single word...)
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
(...for the rest of your life.)
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Now, I'm no silent snob,
but Teller and Silent Bob
tend to do an awful job.
But let me tell you, son:
Harpo Marx is the one.
I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't have a tongue.
Oh, I'll take a vow of silence.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
I'll take a vow of silence.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
I'll take a vow of...
I'll take a vow of...
I'll take a vow of...
Silence,
silence,
silence.
Inside of everybody's head,
inside of everybody's head
there is a hum,
there's a hum,
there's a neverending hum,
and no one ever seems to notice it.
No one seems to notice it.
You have never noticed it.
Never Ever Never Ever.
Until now.
Deep in the dankest corners of the human mind
of any given person you happen to see,
there rests a creature,
or, more specifically,
a critter, hiding and sitting
in the churning, boiling, philosophical pot
of self-aware chowder that we call Thought.
This critter has a name,
but it's different for each person.
Mine is named Corey
and it looks like an armadillo
in Kiss make-up.

Picture your spirit in a delicatessen
in the slums of the universe,
"Open" sign dangling, daring all parasites,
giving you mosquito bites,
sucking out the life out of all of your customers.
But fear not, it's your critter to the rescue,
hum emenating from its lips.
And fear disappears
as the parasite trips
and lands in a puddle,
and that's your rebuttal
to the argument that you
weren't even listening to
because the neverending hum.
Brontosaur
rocking out hardcore,
Triceratops
pissing off the cops,
Iguanodon
with a mohawk on.
Hip hurrah
for the Dinosaurchestra.
Simple and small,
almost alone.
Curled up in a ball
with a tin can phone
tied to a twist
leading outside
and into the mist
where the shadows hide.
Maybe when you're gone
we'll gladly take your place.
You're so nicely drawn.
We like your face and
we want to be your imaginary friend,
want to be your imaginary friend.
When you were young
you knew us well.
The cat had your tongue,
so you could not yell
when you were cross.
All you could do
was call it a loss,
though this was not true.
We've since disappeared.
That is, until tonight
when you turn out the light
and everything stands still.
The wind's direction shifts
and makes the curtains lift...
and you see us on the sill.
Every word that you've learned,
Every wish that you've burned,
Every single strand of hair in your head,
Every book that you've read:
We love you this much.
We want to be your imaginary friend,
want to be your imaginary...

Saw him in a book of fossils
dancing with some old Apostles.
I think if I went back in time
he'd be there, alive,
root of all my jealousy.
Grounded in my devastation,
I can't get no aviation.
Up in the sky, his grandchildren fly.
I don't sing, I sigh.
Tell the Archaeopteryx

When it's fast approaching winter
and I eat my turkey dinner,
tickles of hate, they rattle my cage

This is when I make a choice.
I will build a time contraption.
I will start a chain reaction
Know what I think I'm going to do?
I am going to
Tell the Archaeopteryx
that I never wanted this
featherhead metropolis.
Liar liar, wings on fire.
Now the clock ticks,
and I hope this will fix
all the present bird tricks.
Farewell, Mr. Archaeopteryx
Tell the Archaeopteryx
that I never wanted this
featherhead metropolis.
Liar liar, wings on fire.
I'm without eyelashes.
I noticed, so are you.
We used them on wishes,
and none of them came true.
Terrible, I know, but fair is fair is fair.
I'm blinking up a storm,
but nothing's ever ever there.
I'm without a soulmate.
I noticed, so are you.
What is that, anyway?
Copycat, I hate you.
Mirror mirror on the emotional wall,
I'm dancing like a fool,
but no one seems to care at all.
I'm without any more
things to be without, since
everything I longed for
followed in my footprints.
Now I guess would be the perfect time to die,
so take care of my pets and plants.
And now I'll say good

Indie Cindy & the Lo-Fi Lullabies
released her first LP,
entitled "Moe Is We"
to the private public just the other day
through Cindy's very own label,
Acrobat Unstable Records.
But the only chart
that it even scratched
was in Cindy's heart,
which would fall apart
'cause it was barely attached
to anything other than
broken synthesizer keys,
cassette tapes and burned CDs.
Indie Cindy & the Lo-Fi Lullabies
ain't getting very big
in fact, her only gig
was pathetic even though she dreamed it up.
In fact, it was a nightmare.
the sound just wasn't right there,
and when she woke up,
and when she woke up,
that was when
Indie Cindy broke up.
Indie Cindy broke up.
She broke up
not for artist differences,
she just tore her studio down.
Threw her equipment around
in cyclonic displacement,
'til it looked like her basement again.

You are red and blue and green,
living like a living computer glitch.
You could change to anything.
All you gotta do is just hit the switch.
You are muscle, flesh and bone,
living in the land of automobiles.
If you ever lose your shoes,
all you gotta do is just click your heels.
Symmetry's overrated, methinks.
Look at the scars all over the Sphinx.
Do you know that when you blink
each eye winks slightly out of sync?
Symmetry's overrated, methinks.
Sook at the scars all over the Sphinx.
Even the planet spins with a tilt.
Everybody's built like a quilt.
Have you heard the awful truth?
Cursed asymmetricals go to hell.
If you trip and lose a tooth
you gotta knock the other side out as well.
Gouge both eyes out and you'll see
empty sockets everywhere: self abyss.
Fill them up with mercury
so that I can see myself when we kiss.
Symmetry's overrated, methinks.
Look at the scars all over the Sphinx.
Even the planet spins with a tilt.
Everybody's built like a quilt.
Trees in the forest fall to the side.
Everybody's got something to hide,
except for me and my suitcase
full of imperfections.
If the court has no objections...
Symmetry's overrated, methinks.
Look at the scars all over the Sphinx.
I am lopsided, and so are you.
Nothing worth loving isn't askew.
Oh, for the first time in your life
you're asking me for my advice,
but don't you dare think you're off the hook
without me taking an honest look:
You got nothing up your sleeve,
you got plenty on your mind,
and your mouth is getting dry
because you're yawning all the time,
and the days are getting longer,
but your patience ticks away,
and the wind could knock you over,
if the walls weren't in the way.
What can you do?
What can you do about it?
What can you do?
What can you do?
Oh, you've got to close your eyes...
Strike that, you've got to open them.
Oh, your thoughts are flexible,
but somehow you have broken them.
You're knocking at the door
like you'd rather not find out
what is on the other side
because it proves beyond a doubt
that you never had a clue
what you wanted all along.
You attempt to hold your ground
like being weak is being strong.
What can you do?
What can you do about it?
What can you do?
What can you do?
Oh,

Deep, deep, deep, deep in the ocean
there's a waterproof wristwatch that was dropped
from a boat on a cruise
by a man full of booze,
but even without a wrist it never stopped.
Through an accidental accident at the factory
it was made so that it never need be wound,
for the watch ran on love
which it had plenty of
for deep in the ocean there's plenty of love to be found.
below the boats and sky
there's no such thing as time
there is no need for trying to
put it together
put it together
I believe we'll someday lose our feet,
pick up some gills, and travel
Deep, deep, deep, deep in the ocean,
and enjoy a life that never should get old.
But it can and it will,
for we'll be human still,
and wherever ocean real estate is sold
we'll be buying and selling
and always propelling it forwards,
and the leader of fish will take a stand,
and we shall see it swim
with a wristwatch on its fin
and the race of fish will be taking over our land.
the fish will take our seats
the schools, the farms, the streets
and we'll be stuck down deep and
maybe we'll never
put it together
DEEP IN THE OCEAN,
DEEP IN THE OCEAN
and motionless.
DEEP IN THE OCEAN,
DEEP IN THE OCEAN
THERE'LL BE NO SUN anymore.
below the boats and sky
there's no such thing as time
there is no need for trying to
put it together
we'll be forever
DEEP IN THE OCEAN,
DEEP IN THE OCEAN
and motionless.
DEEP IN THE OCEAN,
DEEP IN THE OCEAN
and motionless.
DEEP IN THE OCEAN,
DEEP IN THE OCEAN
and motionless.
DEEP IN THE OCEAN,
DEEP IN THE OCEAN
and motionless.
So much for our fish friends!
Loose ends
can't be tied... tied...
Old selves have have died.
Goggle eyed
and chased by whales,
swimmin', zoomin',
mermaid tails,
almost human,
skin turned to scales!
I conclude:
We've become sea food.
We've become sea food.
We've become sea food.
We've become sea food.

That's our friend, Super Duper Meteor!
Does this mean we're all gonna die?
Shook my Magic 8-Ball, and it said...
"As a powerful and complex computer of near omniscience, I can report with total confidence, after a careful .3 seconds calculating a whole world of probability and statistics, that yes, we are all gonna die."

 Amnesia was her name, she had beautiful eyes.
And every word she said, it was a little surprise.
Can’t remember when I realized I was in love.
La-la-love.
Can’t remember who it was I was thinking of.
Oh my god... oh my god.
The doctor said I had tomato loss...
All right.
Dr. Amnesia was her name, she had beautiful eyes.
We had spaghetti with long term memory sauce...
All right.
And every word she said, it was a little surprise.
Can’t remember how she smiled when she said my name...
What’s my name?
Can’t remember, cause my heart jumped and hit my brain.
C’est l’amour et blessures.
I guess she didn’t know how to treat me right...
Because I can’t recall where I slept that night.
And I can’t recall that special way
She told me each and every day...
Her name.
I can’t recall the fact that I always said I loved her back...
The same way, every time the same.
The doctor said that I had beautiful eyes.
All right.
Amnesia was her name, she had memory loss.
No, wait...
Well, every word I said, it was a little surprising.
All right.
And every word she said didn’t make it across.
Can’t remember when we walked past the O.R. sign.
Surgery.
Can’t remember passing out with her hand in mine.
My-my-mind.
I remember waking up with my mind repaired.
A-okay.
I remember when I realized she wasn’t there.
The man in stripes and glasses...
The man in stripes and glasses...
The man in stripes and glasses shouted,
"Where am I?"
before a giant cartoon magnifying glass invaded from the sky and made a red and white bespectacled skeleton out of the poor guy.
Well, we never got his name.
Or a very good look.
We collected his remains in a box of books.
Well, we took the books out first,
arranged them best to worst,
just as a waste of time.
And then we put the bones in alphabetically,
sealed it up hermetically,
and never ever spoke of it again.
But every single night,
we see a red and white bespectacled skeleton
in the corner of our eye.
The man in stripes and glasses
is dead.
Dead.
DEAD.
(Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Dead.)
Forever.
Market Town.
What a doozy walking round with all these putrid people everywhere.
"You’ve gotta buy this!"
screams a whiskey stinkin' vermin vendor holding up a rotten pear.
But I hold on to my dollar,
looking all around me.
In this place, I hide my face,
but dirty people hound me.
Market Street.
I could use a bite to eat,
but I don’t want to buy a whole raw fish, no...
No, not a blanket.
Yes, it’s lovely, but I’m hungry,
and that’s really not my favorite dish.
So I hold on to my moolah,
my mazuma, money.
There’s no trash that’s worth my cash.
It all just smells too funny.
In Marketland...
You can buy what’s in demand
fifteen years ago, wow.
In Marketland...
All the world is in your hand.
I’d go wash it off now.
Market Lane.
Either I’m going insane,
or there’s an urchin hawking book reports.
Oh, that’s a new one.
Some old guy with just one eye's
selling his obviously soiled shorts.
But I hold on to my dollar,
looking all around me.
In this place, I hide my face,
but dirty people hound me.
Market Hell.
There’s no food too old to sell.
There is no merchandise too urine-stained.
“You’ve gotta buy this!”
scream the whiskey stinkin' vermin vendors.
Well, at least I’m entertained.
Still I hold on to my moolah,
my mazuma, money.
There’s no trash that’s worth my cash.
It all just smells too funny.
In Marketland...
You can buy what’s in demand
fifteen years ago, wow.
In Marketland...
All the world is in your hand.
I’d go wash it off now.
In Marketland...
You can buy what’s in demand
fifteen years ago, wow.
In Marketland...
All the world is in your hand.
I’d go wash it off now.
Everywhere I look I always see
people who are crazier than me.
Gadzooks!
Gadzooks!
You're all such crazy kooks!
A bunch of flaky flukes.
You're giving me the spooks.
Everyone's gone funny in the head.
I went outside and this is what I said...
I said:
Egad!
Egad!
I think you've all gone mad!
Gone nuts at least a tad.
It's really kind of sad.
How can people so bizarre exist?
(How can people so bizarre exist?)
They should go to a psychiatrist.
(They should go right now.)
By Jove!
By Jove!
You've formed a crazy drove,
and on the streets you rove!
It's something that I loave...
...loathe.
Gorblimey!
Gorblimey!
The situation's getting slimy!
And I am just so stymied!
I can't think of a rhymie.
Gee Willikers!
Gee Willikers!
You're all mentally illikers!
No, this is not a drillikers!
Okay, this is getting sillikers.
Odds-bodkins!
Odds-bodkins!
Don't know what that means.
Gadzooks!
Gadzooks!
You're all such crazy kooky kooks!
I tire of your mind games.
I'm sick of playing Don't Wake Daddy.
Good sir, no more rock paper scissors for me.
But wait, are we not civilized gentlemen here?
I challenge you to a battle of knifes!
KNIFE FIGHT
You're gonna fight for your life!
KNIFE FIGHT
You're gonna fight with a knife!

Let me tell you something: I can't be beat.
Oh yeah?
Yeah. Cuz I'm the king of the street!
Well guess what, man! I'll pin you to the wall!
Oh yeah?
Yeah. Your knife is way too small!
Hey! My knife is super sharp and that's what counts!
I'm gonna make you bleed copius amounts!
Yeah well I'll be sure to thank you right after I shank you!
Punk.

KNIFE FIGHT
You're gonna fight for your life!

This is the END for you, you gutter crawling cur!
I've got a TIP for you, get the POINT?
Yeah, sure.
It's time to face the music!
Time to face the facts!

Oh what is it?!
Knifes are dangerous! We could get hurt!
Hurt? ...I don't want to get hurt.
Who does?
Okay well, in that case, I challenge you to a...
TICKLE FIGHT!
Tickle fight! It's a tickle fight!
Don't bring no knife a tickle fight!
Just bring your fingers, and bring a feather, and everyone can sing together, now:
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!
La-dee-da dum dum tickle fight!
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!
Whoopy-doo zig zag tickle fight!
Ding dong doodly
Nick nack noodly
Fee fi fo fum kitten kaboodly!
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!
Tickle tickle tickle fight!
That was fun... Where's my knife?
I feel knotted up today,
but in a most exquisite way.
Like neckties or like macramé,
bowlines and zeppelin bends.
If you were a theremin,
I wouldn’t know where to begin.
My hands would stay here on my chin
with a hum that never ends.
This suit doesn’t fit me.
I made it myself, counterfeitly,
with buttons of blue
killing me with déjà vu.
It’s a gift for you...
...When I escape at last.
When enough time has passed.
But something keeps me as a pet:
The only house that’s not on fire yet.
I made it when I was an architect.
This is just the side effect.
I feel strangely regular,
but honestly, I prefer it to the usual bizarre.
Damn that oxymoron.
If you were a piece of dust,
I’d shine a light through the busted window
and I’d learn to trust
in the updraft that you’re on.
Click click, auto-focus.
The film’s in the can like hocus-pocus.
A picture of you
killing me with déjà vu.
Don’t know what I’ll do...
...When I escape at last.
When the end of time has passed.
But something keeps me as a pet:
The only house that’s not on fire yet.
I made it when I was an architect.
This is just the side effect.
The punch line is:
There is no punch line.
The punch line is:
There is no punch line.
The punch line is:
There is no punch line.
The punch line is that there is no punch line.
The punch line is that there is no punch line.
The punch line is that there is no punch line.
The punch line is:
There is no punch line.
The punch line is:
There is no punch line.
Oh! I just thought of how to change all the hate
into love, with the old switcheroo.
Dancing in my déjà vu.
You’ll be dancing, too...
When I escape at last,
When the future is the past.
But something keeps me as a pet:
The only house that’s not on fire yet.
The only house that’s not on fire yet.
The only house that’s not on fire yet.
The only house that’s not on fire...
(Yet).
Set sail...
For I am like the whale.
I'm on a different frequency.
Saltwater's my cup of tea...
literally.
Look around.
Adventure can be found.
Dolphins abound and say hello.
They'll show me which way to go.
I know:
There is no horizon
I cannot set my eyes on.
The ocean, the ocean.
I feel a storm approaching
like seagulls in slow motion.
Me and my mermaid girlfriend
ballroom dance on a wave in the ocean!
But keep a careful mind, for you will always find endless danger to brave on the ocean!
That's just the way the ocean is.
Show no fear...
For on this strange frontier
monsters can smell the fear in you.
That's how they know just who to pursue.
We may just slightly lose our way.
But trust me with navigations.
I know the constellations...
Well, some.
There is no horizon
I cannot set my eyes on.
The ocean, the ocean.
I feel a storm approaching
like seagulls in slow motion.
Me and my mermaid girlfriend
ballroom dance on a wave in the ocean!
La la la la la la la the ocean!
Oh yes, we ballroom dance on a wave in the ocean!
And you can't stop our love.
Yes, we ballroom dance on a wave in the ocean!
And you can't stop our love.
In fact, we ballroom dance on a wave in the ocean!
And you can't stop our love.
We ballroom dance to the rhythm of the tide.
Now my body's on land, but my heart will reside
in the only place I've ever felt Pacified,
or Atlanticized, as it were.
I refer
to the ocean.
See the footprints in the cave?
I would follow them, if I were brave,
to find out why there's no second set of
footprints in the cave.
In the attic of this house,
on the wall behind a propped up couch
is a door that somehow leads into
the basement of this house.
Oh, the less you hold out,
more and more will fold out.
Live for the afternoon.
But oh, the more you grow up,
less and less will show up.
Guess it's gotta blow up soon.
If you take another look
in the workings of your pop up book,
there's a secret message left there for you.
Take another look.
If you choose a place to dig,
and you make a hole that's deep and big enough,
you will find exactly what you need:
A place to dig.
Yeah!
Okay now.
Okay, what?
Okay yeah.
Oh oh oh oh, the less you hold out,
more and more will fold out.
Live for the afternoon.
But oh, the more you grow up,
less and less will show up.
Guess it's gotta blow up soon.
Ooh, the less you hold out,
more and more will fold out.
Live for the afternoon.
But oh, the more you grow up,
less and less will show up.
Guess it's gotta blow up soon.
Upward he shoots
by the springs on his boots,
like an inverted angel.
We've been afraid of this terrible,
strange, elusive monster for years.
It seems to be superstitious lunacy
but in fact when things go black
old Spring Heeled Jack appears.
I hear the sound
of him bounding around
on the rooftops of London,
leaving the people bewildered and stunned
and, on occasion, aflame.
No sooner than unsuspecting Englishmen
turn their backs, the wretch attacks,
and Spring Heeled Jack's his name.
I doubt that it's those clever brats in college.
and the Marquess of Waterford denies all knowledge.
And people in the area reek of mass hysteria...
But, admit you must, that it is just enough to scare you.
And you scream when he draws
out a handful of claws
and a blue breath of fire,
then disappears leaping higher and higher,
as if lighter than air.
Time marches on,
now it seems as though he's gone.
This day lacks tales of his acts
but don't relax
for Spring Heeled Jack's still there. 
As we do our thing,
try to keep control...
Careful what we sing.
Rock and roll is everything to everybody that you've ever met.
Dirty socks and all.
If I ever make it to the top I really hope I don't forget:
No one cares how tall I feel, at all.
If I ever write
any songs about being a rock star,
slap me please, all right?
That ain't me.
I've got more to say.
I'm sticking to my guns.
Let the big boys play.
They're the ones that wanted to become the very image they create.
Now that's all they are.
They're the ones with nothing but a lifestyle to which no one can relate.
But they play guitar!
Don't you see how damn cool they are?
Oh no! They take it too far.
Now all the greatest love songs
are secretly about heroin.
If I ever write
any songs about being a rock star,
slap me please, all right?
That ain't me. 
I ask a question,
I let it go just like a balloon.
I'll never need to know.
No need to waste time holding the string.
I already know that I love everything.
I ask for nothing,
but maybe I'm lying.
I don't know nothing,
but I know I'm trying.
It's not the nothingness at the end
so much as message nothingness would send.
I just like the feeling imagining
that every balloon comes back without a string.
I ask for nothing,
but maybe I'm lying.
I don't know nothing,
but I know I'm trying.
It's not for nothing,
that I believe nothing really dies.
Something will always be something.
Not yet asleep but lying in bed,
looking at the ceiling, looking in your head.
It's like the ocean, thoughts can run deep.
Forget it-- Hey you, wake up and go to sleep.
I ask for nothing,
but maybe I'm lying.
I don't know nothing,
but I know I'm trying.
It's not for nothing,
that I believe nothing really dies.
Something will always be something,
in my eyes,
in my eyes,
in my eyes,
in my eyes,
in my eyes,
in my eyes,
in my eyes,
in my eyes,
in my.....
Our love is a great work of satire.
A subtle critique.
Postmodern, a mocking masterpiece
right up there with the Greek.
I've been satirizing ever since
the first day we met.
Our love is a great work of satire
that you just didn't get.
Every time we kissed
it was right up there with Swift.
Red roses and champagne...
It was right up there with Twain.
Our love is my personal soapbox now.
A sarcastic affair
exploding with irony and burlesque
right up there with Voltaire.
I meant not single tender word
that I ever said.
Our love is a great work of satire
that flew over your head.
Flew over your head.
All that he does is chip away.
Each day he sticks to his routine:
Putting the pieces on.
Building a big machine.
He ran out of room inside his room
and so he moved it all outside.
Now it's a bit too big.
Now it's a mile wide.
The family vans across the desert
follow signs to park and stare.
Nobody says hello.
Nobody knows he's there.
They just look at the blinking lights and greebles,
interlocking arms of steel.
And they think:
Nothing could be so big.
Nothing could be so real.
They think:
One million springs
and spinning things. It's quite a view.
We have no clue...
What does it do?
That's the beauty of it--
It doesn't do anything.
He made his own night-vision goggles.
Now he lurks inside the frame.
Perfecting it from within.
Forgetting his own name.
All that he knows is that it needs him.
All it knows is he needs it.
Every piston.
Every single little bit.
The government people in black helicopters
try to snoop around.
I'm so sorry, but he needs the extra parts.
He takes the choppers down.
Now there are tanks on the horizon,
asking what are his demands?
Not one of them understands.
Nobody understands.
All the megaphones scream:
One million gears.
Perhaps our fears are coming true.
What does it do?
What does it do?
That's the beauty of it--
It doesn't do anything.
Lost in solipsism
he then slowly pulls a lever
which sets off a mechanism
which does nothing whatsoever
but the nothing that it does
negates the everything we know
because it's screaming "Just because!"
because it's neither friend or foe
and so we label it a menace
or a grandiose work of art.
From its finale to its genesis
we slowly pull it all apart.
That's the beauty of it--
It doesn't do anything, do anything.
Doesn't do anything, doesn't do anything.
 Where’d you go when you were done?
I’d like to know what you’ve become.
Your biggest fan, awake at dawn,
I cry, I stand on your front lawn.
It’s plain to see you’re scared of me,
But that’s not how it’s supposed to be,
when you’re the reason I’m in town,
and every piece of mind you put down...
Don’t you know I think you’re the cat’s meow?
Where’s the tiger now? Where’s the tiger now?
Bill Watterson, can’t you hear me?
Bill Watterson, please don’t fear me.
Don’t treat me like I have rabies,
I only wanna have your babies.
Tracing lines with fingertips,
I saw the signs within these strips.
And through the fog, between the frames
of dialogue, I saw my name.
And now I know where I must go,
to show you that I love you so.
So I brought books for you to sign,
and I brought shears to cut your phone line.
Don’t you know I think you’re the cat’s meow?
Where’s the tiger now? Where’s the tiger now?
Bill Watterson, can’t you hear me?
Bill Watterson, please don’t fear me.
Don't stare at me from your window.
I know you wanna let me in...
...though, oh!
You want me to show
how much I believe and
prove how far I'll go to meet you,
through thunderstorms and snow...
Well I would do anything.
And oh!
I happen to know
the reason you're hiding
from publicity.
It's not out of eccentricity,
but rather for privacy
when you meet me.
And when we meet I'll be complete.
I'll shake your hand and kiss your feet,
confess my love and buy you flowers.
And eat your heart and absorb your powers.
Don’t you know I think you’re the cat’s meow?
Oh-oh-oh.
Where’s the tiger now? Where’s the tiger now?
Oh oh oh oh!
Bill Watterson, can’t you hear me?
Bill Watterson, please don’t fear me.
Don't run from me like I'm Jason.
I only wanna try your face on. 
Indefinite and definitely dreamed about,
there's something
in my closet, under my bed, but mostly
outside my window.
There's something making noise.
Some terrible kaleidoskull
that ever so gently destroys
the minds of those who believe it.
And though I can't quite perceive it,
I can tell it's there
by the way it's not quite there.
Now there's a lightbulb at the bottom of the sea
that's glowing.
It's like sunlight, the upside-downness of it...
It's saying something.
There's something making light.
No sun, no moon, no weather balloon,
but something purely of the night.
Can't say I know what is in it,
or count the beats per minute.
But I know there's more
washing up upon the shore.
Indefinite and definitely dreamed about,
there's something.
something glowing
something glowing
something glowing
In my closet, under my bed, but mostly
outside my window.
something glowing
something glowing
something glowing
There's something making noise.
Some terrible kaleidoskull
that ever so gently destroys
the minds of those who believe it.
And though I can't quite perceive it,
I can tell it's there
by the way it's not quite there.
Hello there, Spencer.
I see you, you boy, boy.
I see you, Spencer.
With my eyes.
With my eyes.
You’re the architect of my dreams, Spencer.
You plan them, and build them on blue paper,
and hand them to me.
And then I dream them Spencer,
That’s what you do for me.
Thank you for that, Spencer.
You prick.
I’m a magician, Spencer.
A furious magician.
Ooooh.
Avada kedavra, Spencer.
To you, Spencer.
Avada kedavra to you, Spencer.
You think you’re something special, Spencer?
You think you’re something brand new?
Well you’re old oats, Spencer.
You’re old, dry, stale oats, Spencer.
I’m a magician, Spencer.
A furious magician.
Ooooh.
You’re a tall glass of water aren’t you, Spencer?
You boy, precious boy.
I’m Ben Bernanke, Spencer,
and I want your teeth
for the Federal Reserve.
I’m cutting interest rates in half, Spencer,
and I need your teeth.
I’ll admit, Spencer, you’re handsome.
But what have you done with it?
You think you can mock me, Spencer?
Do you?
Do you think you can mock me, Spencer?
Do you think you can capture my essence
and throw it back at me with
humor and rhetorical devices?
Well, you can’t, Spencer.
You don’t know what I’m capable of.
I need your teeth
for my Lonely Hearts Club Band, Spencer.
Ben Bernanke.
I’m a magician, Spencer.
A furious magician.
Oooh.
Are you proud of your country?
Are you proud of your country?
I’ll bet you are,
you pretty little boy...
Sitting up there in your high chair
demanding more applesauce.
You’ve already got enough applesauce, Spencer.
There’s plenty of applesauce on your plate.
I’m going to kiss you, Spencer,
on the lips.
You sexy little rattlesnake.
You naughty little baby boy.
You rambunctious little infant.
My mother tries to get me to go on dates, Spencer.
You know what that’s like?
You know how humiliating that is, Spencer?
You boy, Spencer.
Spencer...
Spencer.
Spencer...
OH MY GOD!
You tall drink of water, Spencer.
I’m a magician, Spencer.
A furious magician.
Oooh.
I’m a magician, Spencer.
A furious magician.
Magician...
Magician...
I love you, Spencer.
I’m gonna spank you silly.
 May I take a nap in your nose?
I have not showered in thirty-six days.
Monkeys are tickling my tummy.
I have not showered in thirty-six days.
Take those pork chops out of your brassiere.
I have not showered in thirty-six days.
Oh no, the babysitter exploded!
Let go of my grandmother’s moustache!
Monkeys are tickling my tummy.
Kiss me under the bologna tree.

I heard a rumor you could help me out.
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
I've waited all my life and now I'm tired.
Just give me what it takes to be admired.
I'm sick of always getting picked last
on the playground and in gym class.
I'm sick of letting guys mistake me
for a punching bag, so make me
Hip Hop Cherry Pop!
Gimme everything you got, every single drop.
All right... all right.
Make me Hip Hop Cherry Pop!
Pretty pretty pretty please with a cherry on top.
All right... all right.
Filled to the brim with paranormal charm,
I'll have at least three sexy ladies on each arm.
Throw out my models and my comic books.
Bring on the helpless boyfriends' jealous looks.
Every day is a metric ton of
ridicule and getting made fun of.
I'm sick of letting girls mistake me
for a pile of dirt, so make me
Hip Hop Cherry Pop!
I know this ain't no ordinary ice cream shop.
All right... all right.
Make me Hip Hop Cherry Pop!
Pretty pretty pretty please with a cherry on top.
All right... all right.
Howie thought brass was the height of style.
Now he's got something of a steampunk smile,
and it's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.
Sally got a dagger hung from her septum.
O'Malley cut his ears off, but wishes that he kept 'em,
and it's all right.
It's all right to look cool.
You do what you do what you do.
Rooney got his skull exposed, doggone it.
Soon he's gonna get scrimshaw carved on it,
and it's all right.
It's all right to look cool.
It's all right, it's all right.
Do what you want with you.
Be nonchalant with screws
stuck through your eyelids,
you new wave of pirates.
Modify.
Modify whatever.
Modify.
Modify and sever.
Modify.
May nothing get rejected.
May nothing get infected.
Mason got Frankenstein stitches installed
adjacent to her eyes cause she wants to look mauled,
and it's all right.
It's all right, it's all right.
Johnny stuck 20 gauge nails through his feet.
Donnie stuck 40 if only to compete,
and it's all right.
It's all right to look cool.
You do what you do what you do.
Stan tried to scarify his neck with a rope.
His plan kinda failed, but it would've been dope,
and it's all right.
It's all right to look cool.

Damn the clowns,
and the puppets with human hands.
Mannequins moving.
My mind barely understands.
Good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,
good old-fashioned nightmare fuel.
I turn away and close my eyes
but it's hard not to visualize some
good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,
good old-fashioned nightmare fuel.
Damn the dolls,
and the robots with human eyes.
Uncanny Valley.
Disfigured, dehumanized.
Good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,
good old-fashioned nightmare fuel.
My heart, it beats at record rates
when Stephen Gammell illustrates
some good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,
good old-fashioned nightmare fuel.
Rapidly aging, and melting away...
Buzz saws for hands, and the monsters of clay...
When videotape logos emerged from the void,
and the unearthly synthesizers they employed,
it was good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,
good old-fashioned nightmare fuel.
I close my eyes and turn away,
but half my mind still wants to play with
good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,
good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,
good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,
good old-fashioned nightmare fuel...
Don't mind me, I've just got some problems to work out.
I'm only passing through or maybe just right out.
Somehow something set my sundial backwards, tilted and upside-down.
Now the shadow hand is pointing time right out of town.
I cease to see you when I start to shut my eyes,
and I forget that I had said my last goodbyes.
Quickly I reopen them and bid you all cheerio, my friend.
This goes on hours and it never seems to end.
I don't remember what it is
that I just said to you.
I've got Anubis on my back
and something in my shoe.
Don't walk backwards.
Don't be jealous.
You're so bloody overzealous.
I think I think I am unsure of what to say.
Live long and prosper while the winter melts away.
Sticks and stones and traffic cones may keep me safe while they break my bones.
Needles live in haystacks like a swarm of tiny drones.
Can't keep my extra senses charged for very long.
Can't bear to tell you that you're wrong, so very wrong.
Can't believe this brief reprieve is stretching outward and up my sleeve.
Simply begs the question, how could I be so naive?
I don't remember what it is
that I just said to you.
I've got Anubis on my back
and something in my shoe.
Don't walk backwards.
Don't be jealous.
You're so bloody overzealous.
Don't walk forwards.
Don't be silly.
You're the heel they call Archilles.
Don't enjoy this private screening.
This one doesn't have a meaning.
If you are a child,
you've probably seen
the Wiggles on TV.
And though they appear
to be best of friends,
there's so much that you don't see.
Soon as the cameras are off, they don't linger
before having cigarette break in the hall.
Scowling, they stare at their shoes and their fingers,
and none of them speaks to the others at all.
This one time on set,
Greg stumbles in drunk,
just like he does every day.
But he lets it slip
he spent all last night
with Anthony's fiance.
Silence, then everything suddenly launches
into a red-yellow-blue-purple fight.
Taping's postponed because Murray's unconscious,
and Jeff cries himself to sleep later that night.
Happily this afternoon, along the beach I waddle.
Looking at the sand, I spy an old forgotten bottle.
I scoop it up and look at it. My eyes go big and wide,
for heavens yes, there seems to be a treasure map inside!
Somewhere at the tail-end of this twisty dotted line
a chest of gold awaits, and soon it's going to be mine.
I buy a sturdy shovel, since the treasure will be deep.
I buy expensive boots, because my old ones are too cheap.
I buy a fancy compass and a treasure-hunting cap.
Then off I set into the forest, eyes upon my map.
So carefully I trace the pathway, every little bend.
It's almost getting dark before-- At last! I reach the end.
I'm so excited, I can't help but do a little jig.
I calm myself, take out my shovel, and proceed to dig.
I dig and dig and dig until my hands begin to hurt.
Then finally, my treasure chest! All worn and caked in dirt.
But when I look inside the chest, I only find a note.
Upon it is this simple little message, and I quote:
"Everybody wants to find a buried treasure chest,
but no one wants to bury one. If you do, be my guest."
Pirates are assholes.
You got a toothache? I don't care.
Cuz you wouldn't believe what I've seen.
Well, would you believe I'm blind as a batlike creature?
Maybe I'm not,
but that's besides the point.
Found objects and funny page wit
allow me to speak when spoken to.
And I tiptoe everso lightly round
and you're kidnapped unawares.
Yes indeed.
We must not fear this as it grows near
Christmas will be soon
Luring like the moon
Decorate your untamed nature
Christmas will be soon
Now, let go of Solstice and save our souls
Christmas will be soon
Very very soon
Idols come and go
Melting like the snow when sunlight comes
Play their drums
Play their drums
Cut down our twig shrine
Sit 'round the big pine beneath a star
This is who we are
One last toast to has-been ghosts
Ooh, Christmas will be soon
Let's stop burning Yule logs
In faith of fool's gods our kids won't know
Idols come and go
Ordinary folk floating like the smoke
We are adrift
Take this gift
Christmas!
Oh, now not one more word
I'm looking forward
So change your tune
Christmas will be soon
And the winds have changed now (The winds have changed)
And we are strange (And we are strange)
Now will you change your tune? (It will be soon)
Christmas will be soon
Decorate your untamed nature
Christmas will be soon
One last toast to has-been ghosts
Ooh, Christmas will be soon
Christmas will be soon
Christmas will be soon
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas
Beneath apocalyptic snowflakes from above
We're not in peril, we are in apoca-love
So let's go walking, or Christmas shopping
No, let's do something a bit more shocking
Let's go to the windmill, let's find some catharsis
Let's go to the graveyard in cover of darkness

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's okay, I've done this tons of times
Well, maybe once a year since I was very young
It will be fine, okay? I do this all the time
And nothing could go wrong, unless that's what you'd like
Is this the first time that you've ever seen
Aurora Borealis crush mankind?
The wind chimes chiming with the screams
A pretty winter night, your hand in mine
The horizon is a fog
From the breath of everyone
And I hope you're having fun
I just had to share with someone
This is the empty building that I call my home
Baby it's cold inside, don't leave me here alone
There's no good movies, but there's a fire
Well, scented candles that are on fire
So let's take the night off, be joyful and joyously
Enjoy the moon-rise, and let it destroy us
And it's okay, as long as we believe we'll be okay
As if anything could go wrong on Christmas Eve
Okay, you know I'm glad you're here
So I can show you this before I disappear
Is this the first time that you've ever seen
Aurora Borealis crush mankind?
A flashlight underneath my chin
A pretty winter night, your hand in mine
Now we're swallowed by the fog
From the breath of everyone
I can barely see you now
But your smile is a frown
Yeah, I knew it had to stop
'Cause I always mess it up
And I get it if you run
I just had to share with someone
Every winter I'm a wreck, yes
Miss my family, merry Xmas
Every day that I am snowed in
I'm a coward, I'm corroding
Seasonal Affective Disorder
Everything can stop on a quarter
(Cold plus hopeless: copeless)
Got no prospects
It's the snow's fault
(Cold plus listless: kissed less)
Got no girlfriend
Pass the snow salt
We have a saying back in my hometown
"When you're feeling down, sunshine fixes everything"
But here, winter is getting longer
Everything's frozen still
Beautiful things no longer give me the chills
Seasonal Affective Disorder
Maybe I should just move to Florida
(Cold plus relapse: collapse)
I am no elf
No Saint Nick, man
(Cold plus morose: comatose)
Trapped in myself
I'm a sick man
Seasonal Affective Disorder
Seasonal Affective Disorder
Seasonal Affective Disorder
Seasonal Affective Disorder
Classified project, moving light
Privately funded silent night
North pole station satellite
Red and white
Laser beams are focusing
Converging on a tyrant king
New dimensions!
Full of presents!
For the children!
In the trillions!
With a little bit of brains
Maybe we can do away
With the lack of candy canes
Make Christmas every day
Through scientific enterprise
Maybe we can open eyes
We can revolutionize
The way we move merchandise
No more naughty, no more nice (It keeps on giving, it keeps on giving)
Just a present and a price (It keeps on giving, it keeps on giving)
It's a pillow, it's a pet (As seen on TV, as seen on TV)
It's a miracle it hasn't happened yet (As seen on TV!)
Oh god, something went wrong
I can't let you see me like this
I walked through the path of the beam
At first I thought I was okay
Overnight my hair turned white
I've been gaining weight
Involuntary spasms
Like a bowl full of jelly
Outbursts of laughter
We must not tell the shareholders
That would be bad
Whoa, something to do with DNA
Something to do with gamma rays
White flowing beard won't go away, go away
Laser beams from outer space
Converging on my mutant face
New dimensions!
Now I'm presents!
Like Pandora!
Oh, the horror!
Body horror, tendons snapping
Ribbons and wrapping, stocking stuffing
Skin is sloughing, bones are bowing
Something is growing, something, oh!
Ah ah-ah-ah
Ah ah ah
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, merry christmas!
I had a dream that I was wearing a really cool wig
(A really cool wig, a really cool wig)
'Cause I was Google Image searching for a really cool wig
(A really cool wig, a really cool wig)
And it was really cool, and it was really fly
I wish I could remember what the fuck it looked like
Most of my friends were jealous, except my blind friends
If only they could see—my really cool wig
My really cool wig, my really cool wig
And I was at a party hanging out with Mos Def
(Ooh-wee-ooh, wee-ooh-ooh...)
Nobody else was dancing so I danced with Mos Def
(I danced with Mos Def, I danced with Mos Def)
We did an awesome dance, we had an awesome time
We started making out, but then some pizza arrived (Fuck yes!)
We ate the whole pizza, and the entire time
I never took off—my really cool wig
My really cool wig, my really cool wig
My really cool wig, my really cool wig, my really cool wig
My mega rad wig, my hella sweet wig, my "holy shit!" wig
I wish I could remember what it looked like
(My really cool wig, my really cool wig, my really cool wig)
I wish I could remember what it looked like
(My really cool wig, my really cool wig, my really cool wig)
When I woke up I was feeling pretty good, I must say
(I really felt great, I really felt great)
I started Google Image searching for my wig right away
(Before it could fade, before it could fade)
I looked at every picture, I spent a lot of time
But I could not remember what the fuck it looked like
I don't want fame and fortune, I don't want a happy life
I just want to die—in my really cool wig
My really cool wig, my really cool wig
My really cool wig
My really cool wig, my really cool wig, my really cool wig
My wicked tight wig, my crazy sick wig, my gangsta-ass wig
I wish I could remember what it looked like
(My really cool wig, my really cool wig, my really cool wig)
I wish I could remember what it looked like
(My really cool wig, my really cool wig, my really cool wig)
(My really cool wig, my really cool wig, my really cool wig)
(My really cool wig, my really cool wig, my really cool wig)
(My really cool wig, my really cool wig, my really cool wig...)

A mask of my own face
I'd wear that, I'd wear that
I'd wear that mask of my own face
I'd wear that, I'd wear that
I'd wear it to a hoedown, and I'd dance with all the belles
And none of them would know that I was secretly myself
I'd rob my own apartment and I wouldn't give a damn
I'd blame it on the person that nobody knows I am
I look into my eyeholes, what do I see?
(Look into my eyeholes, what do you see?)
I look into my eyeholes and what do I see?
A handsome motherfucker motherfucking looking back at me
A mask of my own face
I'd wear that, I'd wear that
I'd wear that mask of my own face
I'd wear that, I'd wear that
[Harmonica Solo]
I'd wear it on Thanksgiving and I'd laugh in the parade
At all the people hissing, knowing I'm the one they hate
And at the big finale I would tear my face away
And smile as they grip their own and try to do the same
I look into my eyeholes and what do I see?
(Look into my eyeholes, tell me what you see)

(scream)
To the girl who cried monster
It's me, the ghost next door
I think I'm in deep trouble
You're the one I'm dying for
Every night in terror tower
I meet you in a dream
I say that you can't scare me
But in my heart I scream
You give me Goosebumps
Goosebumps
Honey, beware, you're in for a scare
Oh no
Beneath the haunted mask I wear
My eyes light up for you
I feel you in my monster blood
Am I in your monster blood II?
The scarecrow walks at midnight
But I walk all alone
Up and down the ghost beach
Where I found your bones
You give me Goosebumps
Goosebumps
Goosebumps
Goosebumps
Goosebumps
Goosebumps
Honey, beware, you're in for a scare
Oh no
Jaws, the shark, a-lurking in the dark
Of the depths of the sea, one day on a lark
Decides to get rowdy, get real violent
Takes a vay-cay out to Amity Island
Sunshine, lotion, fun in the sun
Blood in the ocean, everybody run!
'Cause it's crazy how few fucks this shark gives
He'll eat naked ladies! He'll eat little kids!
Oh no!
But the one thing keeping the community safe
Is a guy named Brody and his pal Richard Dreyfuss
Jaws don't know that a storm's gonna come
He just wants everyone to be his chum!
(Get it? Get it?)
The mayor don't care if the townsfolk die
He doesn't wanna spoil the fourth of July
He's like, "Everyone cool it, and go for a swim!"
But holy shit, here comes that fin!
Singing Jaws is here!
Here is Jaws!
(He is a shark without a cause)
He was in a movie, you should watch it, it's called Jaws
Jaws is here!
Here is Jaws!
(He is a shark who fights the law)
He was in a movie that everyone saw
Long story short, the beach gets closed
The mayor's like, "Okay, yeah, this blows"
Suddenly Jaws has got a price on his head
But the wrong little shark baby ends up dead
It was Jaws' little brother, now he's pissed!
The mayor just shot to the top of his list
He sneaks in his house in the middle of the night
And he eats that fucker in a single bite!
Golly
(Do-do-do-doo-do-do-doo-do
Scooby-doop-do-do-doop-do-do-doo!)
Now the mayor's dead, so Brody's in charge
He knows the real killer is still at large
So he and the Dreyfuss make a decision
They're going on a mission, they're gonna go fishin'... for Jaws!
A man named Quint lets them use his boat
On the condition that he be the one to cut Jaws' throat
'Cause he was a sailor back in World War II
And Jaws ate his entire crew, woah!
Jaws is here!
Here is Jaws!
(He is a shark without a cause)
He was in a movie, a movie called Jaws!
Jaws is here! (Ah-ah-ah)
Here is Jaws! (Oo-uh-oh)
(He is a shark who fights the law)
He was in a movie that everyone saw
They're out on the sea, they wait all night
Where could Jaws be? He's nowhere in sight
Dreyfuss decides to go down in a cage
And Jaws shows up in a full-on rage!
He tears up the cage like paper in a shredder
While Dreyfuss makes his wet-suit wetter
He hides behind a rock like a cowardly prick
And he doesn't come back until the end of the flick
Brody's like, "We're gonna need a bigger boat,"
So they go back home and get a bigger boat
The biggest boat that's ever sailed
Gonna kick Jaws' ass, or I guess, his tail
Yeah, his tail
But oh my shit!
Jaws jumps out and Quint gets bit!
Right in half like a Kit-Kat bar!
Up in the sky there's a shooting star
That's Quint, up in heaven, he's a star now
Brody's angry, he's all like, "Fuck it"
He takes a harpoon and welds it to a rocket
Jaws' last words are, "Woah, respect"
Then he explodes and it's a pretty good effect, yeah!
Jaws is dead!
Long live Jaws!
(He was a shark without a cause)
He was in a movie, you should watch it, it's called Jaws
Jaws is dead! (Ah-ah-ah)
Long live Jaws! (Ah-ah-ah)
(He was a shark who fought the law)
He was in a movie that everyone saw
(He was in a movie that everyone saw)
He was in a movie that everyone saw
Jaws is dead! (Ah-ah-ah)
Long live Jaws! (Ah-ah-ah)
(He was a shark without a cause)
He was in a movie, called Jaws!
(Jaws is dead!)
At the Academy Awards
(Long live Jaws!)
He was robbed
(He was a shark without a cause)
Sharks exist in real life
Woah!
(He was in a movie that everyone saw)
Jaws is dead (Ah-ah-ah)
Long live Jaws
My basement, uh
Gonna show you my beautiful basement
Where the concrete floor feels cool to the touch
I'll turn up the heat if it's too much
I'll turn on the light bulb on the wire
Turn on the dehumidifier

Look you in the eye, and I say "check this"

In the club, the Model Railroad Club
A motherfucker said shit about my trains
Might as well have took a shit on my brain
'Cause I went insane
I laid track on his ass with a styrofoam bat
But the president never did let me back after that
Shit, I said, "Fuck you
Who the fuck needs a punk ass choo-choo crew anywho?"
My trains, uh
My trains, uh
I got small ones, tiny little trains
I come down here just to get away

Chugga chugga woo-woo

I lie here every night
I feel like if I focus
And think of getting smaller
I'll gradually get smaller
And if I get small enough
My trains will seem much bigger
And I'll be the conductor
The tiniest conductor
Oh, then whatchu gonna do?
Then whatchu gonna do?
Whatchu gonna do then, huh?
Whatchu gonna do?
Whatchu gonna do?
Whatchu gonna do when I'm fucking small
Like one inch tall
You won't see me coming at all
When I crawl into your ear late at night
Yeah, you heard me right motherfucker, sleep tight
And you think I'm just another bad dream
But I'm a tiny little man in your bloodstream
Little hands hold an artery shut
Yeah, that's right motherfucker, then what?

I think it's time
For you to know
The awful truth
The truth about me, and the truth about you
'Cause you're a brand new species
Big cat (Uh oh!)
Space Nazis, Robert Stack (Uh oh!)
God damn it, gonna snap (Oh, oh oh oh oh)
Leonard Nimoy, call me back (Call me back!)
I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (Of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out
'Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one
On your A.M., A.M. radio
Oh, I'm crying now
Authentic tears
They flow out of me when I think about you
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand the meaning of this
Oh my God!
I try and I try and I try (To make you listen to me)
I try to call you every day

I'm the only one (Hey!)
On your A.M., A.M. radio
(Ooh)
Don't hang up yet, I'm not done
I'm an expert, I'm the one
The one who was right all along
Better to be laughed at than wrong
I'm an expert in my field
UFOlogy, yes, it's all real
Ancient aliens, it's all true
I'm an expert just like you
And like you, I'm a genius before my time
Disbelieving, that's the real crime
Pretty soon they'll discover me
In the Super-Sargasso Sea!
I try to call you every day
What can I say
When the truth comes out? (Of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out (Now, now, now)
'Cause I'm the right one
(On my touch-tone telephone) On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
(I'm the only one on your A.M. radio!) I'm the only one
On your A.M., A.M. radio
The day they found me, I hadn't yet been played
Inside my workshop behind the old arcade
Electric desires had unraveled all my wires
Now I'm in a box for safekeeping
The news reporters reported that I died
But all my organs were living on inside
Circuit board to brain with two lungs collecting change
One big human heart gently beeping
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you, unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
Thank God for business, they let me take the floor
I stood so proudly, like I was going to war
Players soon appeared and I quickly was revered
This must be what love would have felt like
Such dedication, they came from miles away
With eyes so piercing, they'd wait their turn to play
Perfect patient lines, because I was in their minds
I could do whatever I felt like (Whatever I felt like)
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
I'm happy for years and years and
Only eating the occasional maintenance man
Only driving a few kids to madness
Maybe they were predisposed to madness, who knows?
I only want to have fun
But now they're telling me my days here are done
Cause there's a tiny little box they make in Japan
And pretty soon it's gonna fit in your hand
It's getting lonely, it's getting hard to breathe
The arcade's empty, I think it's Christmas Eve
Someone's broken in, now they're painting on my skin
Breaking me and taking my quarters
Bashing in my face with a crowbar
Kicking me and pushing me over
Now they see my blood on their sneakers
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
Oh, knowing what we know, knowing we don't know
This is gonna change our world
Feeling how I feel, I'll accept the unreal
If you be my no-eyed girl
From nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light, blinding white
Your matter tells mine to scatter
It's alright, it's alright
From the moment that we met
I've been awake like I've never been awake in all my life
If I spoke your language I could tell you how I feel
But your language isn't real
In every myth there's a little bit of truth
But I cannot say a thing (I cannot say a thing)
Without proof, oh no
Knowing what we know, knowing we do not know
This is gonna change our world
I might go insane if I learn your full name
If you be my no-eyed girl
From nowhere mankind can go
There's too much light, blinding white
Emotions, human implosions
It's alright, it's alright
Right before the kiss I noticed something in the air
Molecules existed when there should have been none there
Chemical reactions with the surface of your skin
Some will say my actions let the no-eyed people in
And I'd do it all again, and I'd do it all again, and I'd do it all again
When he died
Turns out he left behind a mansion full of other people's skulls
The odd thing is, they never found his own, when he died
When he died
He somehow left behind strange symbols on the floor beneath his corpse
Investigators said the wood was scorched, when he died
When he died they found so many scorpions inside his lungs
When he died the statues of his missing children cried
What was later found to be his blood
When he died (On a dark and stormy night)
They telephoned his wife (Who reacted with delight)
But gradually her voice began to fade to nothing
And the Laughing Record played
The Laughing Record played
When he died
They found a message etched into his spine
That said when he died an endless age of untold nightmares would be nigh
And the blood would make the seas run red
When he died (On a dark and stormy night)
A nearby shed caught fire (It simply caught alight)
And when they cleared the charred wood from the ground
Inside they found a painting of a clown (A creepy painting of a clown)
He'd painted it he was just a child
But scrawled upon the back was exactly when he died
When he died, when he died, when he died, when he died
Your body is so sweet now, baby
I'm saying trick or treat now
You know I've got to have you, yeah
You sexy sweet cadaver
All wrapped up like a mummy
I'll cover you in honey
And wait a hundred years or so
You know, you know
It isn't sexual (It isn't sexual)
Strictly confectional (Strictly confectional)
Strictly medicinal (Strictly medicinal)
If a little nontraditional
I'm digging up your coffin
And pouring out the contents
Your sexy sweet solution
Is prime for distribution
Sweet bod
Your body's starting rumors
Of mason jars of sweetness
Whose satisfied consumers
Have often claimed to witness
Some sexy shrinking tumors
A sweet return to fitness
They're just a hundred bucks or so
You know, you know
It isn't sexual (It isn't sexual)
Strictly professional (Strictly professional)
Entrepreneurial (Entrepreneurial)
Oh, and what a sweet memorial
I'm digging up your coffin
And pouring out the contents
Good God I'm glad to see you
Won't you be my panacea?
Sweet bod
Sweet bod, oh
Sweet bod
Sweet bod
Sweet bod
Extra clever
Earthbound spirit
Ghost in the form
Of a mongoose
And I have hands
And I have feet
I'll never die
I am a freak
Hello, I'm here
I'm living in the wall
I know I might be small, but
I, I, I, am a
Freak
Thou wilt never
Know what I am
I am the fifth dimension
And I'll split the atom
And if you see me
You're paralyzed
Pillar of salt
You're mummified
Hello, I'm here
I'm living in the wall
I know, I might be small
But I am the Eighth Wonder
And I was born
1852
And I was born
In India
And I shall haunt
Like the Buggane
With such weird noise
And clanking chains
Hello, I'm here
I'm living in the wall
I know I might be small, but
I, I, I, am a
Freak
I say "vanished"
To underground
Jim, let me go
I watch like Hell
[Pre-Chorus]
And I have hands
And I have feet
I'll never die
I am a freak
Hello, I'm here
I'm living in the wall
I know I might be small
But I am the eighth wonder
Eighth wonder of the world
You'll never get to see
What in the name of God can I be?
My mind's this cave
So dark, no moon, no stars
No sound, just hearts and walls of art
Strange things happen
For no reason
That's all I know
My mind's this cave
So dark, no moon, no stars, no stars
No sound, just hearts and walls of art
These creatures I've seen
Some of them edible, some of them mean
That's all I know
I'm not like you
You fly
You burn my eyes, my eyes
You speak in my mind
Your kind all died when you arrived
I saw you making fire
Strange things happen for no reason at all
I can't help you
You're not human
You're not animal
My mind's this cave
So dark, no moon, no stars, no stars
No sound, just hearts and walls of art
And you, you fly
You burn my eyes
You speak in my mind
You seem surprised that I don't hear you
Cold and windy
Dark and stormy
Let me float your way
Please don't ignore me
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(An ambient man) A trick of the light to love you tonight
You don't understand, there's nothing quite like a soft, fuzzy man
Can't you see me?
Why can't you see me?
I'm all around
All cold and dreamy
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(A wisp of smoke man) To waft over you and cloud up your view
So show me your hands and wave them right through a soft, fuzzy man
Although I have no arms to hold you in
A human passion burns within me
I need to feel like I exist
So please, baby, please, baby step into the mist
Don't be nervous
No, don't be nervous
I'm not like other guys
Who have a surface
What you girls really need's a soft, fuzzy man
(An atmospheric man) A shimmering puff of indistinct love
What's better than the vague embrace of a soft, fuzzy man?
Who seeps through your thoughts
Who makes you see spots
Who blows through the air
Who plays with your hair
I know it sounds crazy
But once you go hazy, you'll understand
I'm your soft, fuzzy man
Hey, turn your techno music down
Your grandpa's coming by tonight
No, I don't want to hear it, we'll be having macaroni
You will be polite when he's here tonight
Don't talk about the internet
Your grandpa doesn't understand
You will not bring your Game Boy or whatever to the table
Do you understand? (He doesn't understand)
He doesn't understand
As your father I expressly forbid it
As your father I expressly forbid it
As your father I expressly forbid it
I'm your dad, I'm your dad
What happened to my medicine?
The stuff I take to keep my hair
It's obvious you stole it and you sold it on the street
'Cause you don't even care if I lose my hair
Okay, I found my medicine
I'm sorry that I yelled at you
But let this be a lesson, if you ever steal my medicine
That's what I'll do, I'll yell at you
As your father I expressly forbid it
As your father I expressly forbid it
As your father I expressly forbid it
I'm your dad, I'm your dad
As your father I expressly forbid it, yeah
As your father I expressly forbid it, woah
As your father I expressly forbid it
I'm your dad, yeah yeah yeah
As your father I expressly forbid it
As your father I expressly forbid it
As your father I expressly forbid it
I'm your dad, I'm your dad
I'll quit my job, the day I die
I'll quit my job the day I die
I break my back, and never cry
I break my back and never cry
I'm losing all my hair, losing all my hair
I'm losing all my hair because a man provides
I'm standing on a chair, standing on a chair
I'm standing on a chair because I earn my life
I earn my life, I earn my life
I learned it from my father and I tell it to my wife
Jesus Christ, don't tell me not to hurry
I wouldn't be so worried if I wasn't always right
While you're asleep
I'm terrified
While you're asleep I'm terrified
I see the end before my eyes
I see the end before my eyes
A marker on a grave, marker on a grave
Marker on a grave and I know I'm the one who died
And underneath the name, underneath the name
Underneath my name it says, "He Earned His Life"
I earn my life, I earn my life
I learned it from my father and my father never lied
Jesus Christ, better learn how to forage
Utilities and mortgage are all that will survive
I wish my life was on a graph
So I knew how much left I have to earn tonight
It burns too bright
It burns too bright
I think about myself a lot
Cause it's the only one I've got
I've earned this life
What have I done to earn this life?
I earn my life, I earn my life
I learned it from my father and I tell it to my wife
Jesus Christ, don't tell me not to hurry
I wouldn't be so worried if I wasn't always right
Cause I earn my life, I earn my life
I learned it from my father and my father never lied
Jesus Christ, we better learn how to forage
Utilities and mortgage are all that will survive
Utilities and mortgage are all that will survive
In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem
Government is the solution to our problem
Are you unhappy, girl, in this confusing world?
Where everything you earn is getting left to burn?
If it were up to me, then living would be free
And I can give you that, and I can give you that
They'll take your money
Into their greasy hands
And spend your money (They do this to disrespect you)
And take away your land (I know kung fu, I will save you)
Cause you're worth saving, baby
Deregulating, baby
I'm Ronald Reagan, baby
I'm Ronald Reagan, yeah
I'll save you, honey
You'll never be alone
I'll save the business (If you love me, say you love me)
That you will someday own (They hate freedom, I'll defeat them)
Not like in comics, baby
With economics, baby
With Reaganomics, baby
Atomic bomb it, yeah
Government is not the solution to our problem
Government is the solution to our problem
Government is not the solution to our problem
Government is the solution to our problem
Are you unhappy, girl, in this confusing world?
Where everything you earn is getting left to burn?
If it were up to me, then money would be free
And I can give you that, and I can give you that
If you just hold my hand (If you just hold my hand)
If you just close your eyes (If you just close your eyes)
If you get in my car (If you get in my car)
I'll take you for a ride (I'll take you for a ride)
With Reaganomics, baby
With Reaganomics, baby
With Reaganomics, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
(With Reaganomics, with Reaganomics, with Reaganomics)
I want to meet potential architects all night
I want to purchase urban real estate all night
I want to study local zoning laws all night
I want to calculate construction costs all night
I have a vision of a man-made object
I have the money, I have the means
I have the strangest dreams
I caught insomnia from looking at the moon
I found a picture of a rectangle I drew
I am an altogether different man by day
I have the influence to send that man far away
I have a vision of a man-made object (Towering over all)
I have a vision of a man-made object (Towering over all)
I have a vision of a man-made object (Towering over all)
I have a vision of a man-made object (Towering over all)
I have the money, I have the means
I've been having the strangest dreams, baby
Over and over
The pheromones, the overwhelming harmony
Consuming the colony
The Circle rules your life
Chop, chop, don't want to be late
Lift up and carry your weight
You've got no choice but to dance
In a spiral of ants
True bugs might laugh in your face
Don't fret, you're leading the race
Don't let the bastards step on your hands
In a spiral of ants
You can't remember where you came from (In a spiral of ants)
You can't remember where you're going (In a spiral of ants)
You can't remember knowing
You are one ant
Over, it's over
The pheromones, the self-avoiding odyssey
Consuming the colony
The Circle rules your life
Now, now, don't run out of breath
Don't feel surrounded by death, no
Take the wheel, this could be your chance
In a spiral of ants
False bugs, you'll soon be alone
See how they drop like a stone
You're free now forever to dance
In a spiral of ants
Now you remember where you came from (From a spiral of ants)
Now you remember where you're going (To a spiral of ants)
You've got to keep it flowing
You are one ant (Over, over, over)
Over and over
The pheromones, the overwhelming harmony
Consuming the colony
Creating its own gravity
Before we knew it we became a hurricane
And the bugs who laughed got blown away
As we proclaimed:
The Circle rules your life
Would you like to go deep inside the Crisis Actors studio?
Would you like to see all the things they never show you on TV?
Your baby's alive (Your baby's alive)
Your family's fine (Your family's fine)
Imagine a time (Imagine a time)
When dinosaurs ruled the earth
We can rule the earth
They've been leaving clues; unobtrusive twenty-threes and fourty-twos
Those who do the math have been known to end up drowning in the bath
The names are made up (The names are made up)
The problems are real (The problems are real)
The future was sealed (The future was sealed)
When dinosaurs ruled the Earth
We can rule the Earth
Malevolent gods (Malevolent gods)
Are better than none (Are better than none)
Malevolent gods (Malevolent gods)
Are better than none (Are better than none)
Malevolent gods (Malevolent gods)
Are better than none (Are better than none)
Malevolent gods (Malevolent gods)
Are better than none (Are better than none)
Malevolent gods (Malevolent gods)
Are better than none (Are better than none)
The damage is done
Redesign your logo, we know what we're doing
We are here to help you; everything's connected
Time is of the essence, we live in the future
Color makes us hungry; everything's connected
Redesign your logo, we know how to do it
Make the calculations, put them into action
We will find the angle, starting with convention
On to innovation; everything's connected
Here we have a circle, smooth and inoffensive
This will be the basis for your revolution
Gravity is crucial, geomagnetism
With some calculation, we will find your logo
DNA is crucial, we must understand it
In the human genome we will find your logo
Everyone will see it, every demographic
If they fail to see it, are they even human?
Every demographic: men 18 to 30
College educated women over 40
Suicidal poets, fat Midwestern fathers
Kids with diabetes, Pentecostal preachers
Mothers under 20, interracial couples
Atheist professors, government employees
Xenophobes and racists, private aviators
Everyone will see it, every demographic
Think about it this way: guided evolution
This will be a new breed: cutting edge, but classic
Fully complimentary, bold and self-sufficient
Symbolizing freedom, and, of course, your product
When the logo's finished, then we will unveil it
Seven billion people instantly enlightened
Everyone's rebranded, all the fighting's over
Say goodbye to conflict, that design's rejected
There's no longer language, only recognition
There's no longer country, only corporate colors
Color makes us hungry, hunger makes us human
Everyone can see it; everything's connected
Redesign your logo, give us all your money
Redesign your logo, give us all your money
Redesign your logo, give us all your money
Redesign your logo, give us all your money

Pizza Heroes
Hour hand's gone from two to three, now four
You've barely slept all night, all the noise and lights and party songs next door are too much
They make you sweat, half-awake, soaking wet
Fever dream, people screaming bloody murder
Paint chips flaking off the neighboring wall
And as the night goes on and threatens dawn
The music fills the halls, they're in your house
You lock the door
You shut your eyes tight as your window breaks
Someone, something takes your hand
You don't understand, you can't understand it
Eyes shut tight, never open up
(Too late) You've been invited
(Too late) You're at the party
(Wake up, wake up) And it's a place you've seen before, you've seen before
A place you've seen before you were born
Now you are dancing
You're with your people
You're not alone
Now you are drinking
Having a party
You're not alone
(Too late) You are the party
(Wake up) You are the nuisance
(Too late) You're not alone
(Wake up) It's not a nightmare
(Too late) You are delightful
(Wake up) You're not alone
(Too late) You've been invited
(Wake up) You're at the party
(Too late) You're not alone
(Wake up) You've been invited
(Too late) You're at the party
And you notice that the Sun's not rising and the birds are dead
There's only dust on the floor where people were before
And the dream won't leave your head, it won't leave
You need a drink, half-empty bottles in the sink
Down the drain, sudden rain outside alarms you
Hour hand's gone and now you're feeling strange
Now your hands grow strong, your fingers long and your face, your face begins to change
You're mesmerized, you want to cover up your eyes
But they're already shut so tight
A whisper in your ear
Only you can hear, only you can hear it
Eyes shut tight, never open up
Too late...
Too late...
You've been invited, you're at the party
It's a place you've seen before
(Too late) You've been invited (Too late) You're at the party
(Wake up, wake up) And it's a place you've seen before
You've seen before
A place you've seen before you were born
Before you were born
Before you were born
Before you were born
(Too late) You've been invited
(Wake up) You're at the party
(Too late) You're not alone
(Wake up) You've been invited
(Too late) You're at the party
(Wake up) You're not alone
(Too late) You are the uproar
(Wake up) You are the party
(Too late) You're not alone
(Wake up) It's not a nightmare
(Too late) You're at the party and you're not alone
There is anger in this country
It fills the hearts of these people
Eating with anger
Dancing with anger
Falling in love
With each other with anger
When a man and a woman hate each other very much
They make love angrily
Like birds of prey (and Africanized bees)
And with a little bit of luck they'll conceive
They will conceive
An evil baby
Nine horrible months
And then she is born
Ripped into a world
That doesn't want her
A beautiful girl
She's screaming already
She's learning to walk
Walking with anger
She's learning to talk
She says she hates you
She wants you to pay
For bringing her here
You've never been chased by a baby before
You secretly wish she had never been born
You secretly wish you hadn't bought her a gun
What were you thinking?
But now it's too late
She fires her gun
Now there's a hole in your face
You hate to show weakness
In front of your child
But sooner or later
Everybody must die
Die by the hand
Of their own evil baby
You realize this now
It makes you feel...
Hey, look out!
We're angry people!
Exploding in love
We're completely normal!
Throwing bottles at God
You did this to us!
Why did you do this to us?
We're angry people
With financial problems!
Making evil babies
Evil babies with guns
It's completely normal
Everything's completely normal!
Hey, look out!
We're angry people!
Exploding in love
We're completely normal;
Throwing bottles at God
You did this to us!
Why did you do this to us?
We're angry people
With financial problems!
Making evil babies
Evil babies with guns
It's completely normal
Everything's completely normal
Put on your glasses
Get your calculator
There's too many people
Drinking too much water
Over populating
Every jurisdiction
Their phones are ringing
Simultaneously
1-800 number?
Let it go to voicemail
If it's that important
They'll leave a message
I mean we're normal people
Too busy to talk
At the supermarket
Buying bottles of water
The big one is coming
I hope you have a basement
Take off your glasses
Let me see your eyes
They're red and bloodshot
Exactly like mine
That's completely normal, everything's completely normal
We're angry people!
Exploding in love
We're completely normal;
Throwing bottles at God
You did this to us!
Why did you do this to us?
We're angry people (turning into tigers)!
We're angry people (turning into wolves)!
We're angry people (turning into tigers)!
We're angry people (turning into wolves)!
We're angry people (turning into tigers)!
We're angry people (turning into wolves)!
We're angry people (turning into tigers)!
We're angry people (turning into wolves)!
We're angry people (turning into tigers)!
We're angry people!

You’re silver to the silver
You have silvs in Kokomo
If you hear silver calling you
Then that's where you should go
But never go down to silvertown
Never go down to silvertown
Oh no!
There ain’t no silver high enough
So keep running up that silv
Or look under the silver, silver
In silvershorthairville
That’s silv!
But never go down to silvertown
The silv ran out and the silv burned down
So stay the hell out of silvertown for me
You must never go down to silvertown, you see
You silv!
If you wanna silv I don’t care
You can dance silver anywhere
In the silver time
In the air silver
Or in silverdise
By the silver light
But never go down to silvertown
I think it’s some kind of burial silv
Just stay the hell out of silvertown
Oh no!
People keep going to silvertown
And leaving me silver
I get the silvs imagining
The silver things they find
Silvers keep going to silvertown
And never silver back
I miss my silvs and silvershorts
And now you’re all I silv
So never go down to silvertown
You’ll disappear and you’ll silver be found
So stay the hell out of silvertown for me
For me (for me)
Never go down to silvertown
There’s something silver lurking around
So stay the fuck out of silvertown for me
For me
For me
You must never go down to silvertown, you see
